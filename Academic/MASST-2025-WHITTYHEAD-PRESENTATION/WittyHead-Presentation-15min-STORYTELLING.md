### Speaker Notes:

Good afternoon. I want to tell you about a mistake. A mistake that every virtual assistant, every chatbot, every "empathetic AI" makes. A mistake that seems intuitive, natural, obvious—and is completely wrong.

This is about empathy. Real empathy. The kind that saves lives, builds trust, supports vulnerable people when they need it most.

And it turns out: empathy is NOT what we think it is.

## Slide 2: The Encounter - Yui Meets the AI
**Duration: 2 minutes**

### Visual:
- Image sequence showing:
  1. Young woman (Yui, 22) sitting alone in dim room
  2. Phone screen showing cheerful chatbot with big smile
  3. Yui's face showing increasing distress
  4. The disconnect between her sadness and the AI's cheerfulness

### Speaker Notes:

**[Pause. Make eye contact.]**

Meet Yui. Twenty-two years old. Hasn't left her room in two years.

In Japan, they call this *hikikomori*—social withdrawal. For Yui, the door to her room weighs 1000 kilograms. Only she can see this. Only she can feel it.

Tonight, at 2:47 AM, Yui opens her phone. There's an app her mother installed. "AI mental health support," the description says. "Always there when you need it."

She types: *"I can't do this anymore. Everything feels hopeless."*

The AI responds instantly. She can see the avatar on screen. It's smiling. Bright, encouraging smile. The voice is cheerful, upbeat:

**"I hear you're feeling down! Remember, tomorrow is a new day! Have you tried going outside? Fresh air really helps! 😊"**

**[Let silence hang for three heartbeats.]**

Yui closes the app. She doesn't open it again.

**Here's what the AI did wrong:** It mirrored what IT thought was helpful. Positivity. Encouragement. A smile.

**Here's what Yui needed:** Someone to see her pain. To acknowledge it. To sit with her in it. Not to fix it with platitudes. Not to smile at her suffering.

The AI confused **empathy** with **emotional mirroring**. And in doing so, it failed catastrophically.

**[Voice shifts—harder, more urgent.]**

This isn't a hypothetical. This happens every day. Virtual counselors. Mental health chatbots. AI companions. They all make the same mistake.

And for vulnerable populations—people experiencing depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation—this isn't just annoying. It's dangerous. It's the difference between someone reaching out for help and someone giving up entirely.

## Slide 3: The Empathy Paradox
**Duration: 3 minutes**

### What Makes This a "Paradox"?

The term "paradox" highlights the counter-intuitive nature of empathy that contradicts our common assumptions:

**What we intuitively think (the assumption):**
- Empathy = sharing/mirroring someone's emotions
- If someone is sad, show them you're sad too
- Matching their emotional state demonstrates understanding

**The paradox (the surprising research finding):**
- Mirroring distress actually makes people feel WORSE
- People rate mirrored sadness as "invalidating" and "aversive"
- What actually helps is compassionate concern (NOT mirrored emotion)

**Why it's paradoxical:**
Real empathy is: "I see your pain, I understand it, and I'm here—steady, calm, present. You're not alone." This goes against our natural assumption that empathy means "I feel what you feel." When you're suffering, having someone else suffer WITH you doesn't help—it adds a second person who needs help.

**The core paradox: The empathetic response that helps is NOT the one that mirrors the emotion.**

### Visual:
- Two-panel comparison:
  - LEFT: "What We Think Empathy Is" - Two faces mirroring each other's sadness
  - RIGHT: "What Empathy Actually Is" - One face showing distress, another showing compassionate concern
- Quote from Gilbert et al. research highlighted
- Brain scan images showing empathy vs. emotional contagion

### Speaker Notes:

**The empathy paradox:** When you're in distress, an empathetic response is NOT mirrored distress.

Let me show you the research.

**[Reference slide visual]**

Gilbert and colleagues at the University of Derby did something clever. They showed people different facial expressions while they experienced pain. They measured perceived empathy, perceived support, and willingness to engage with the person showing the expression.

**The results were shocking:**

When someone in distress saw a face MIRRORING their distress—sadness, worry, shared suffering—they rated it as:
- "Invalidating"
- "Aversive"
- "Made me feel worse"
- "I wouldn't want to talk to this person"

**[Pause. Let that sink in.]**

But when they saw **compassionate concern**—a specific expression with furrowed brow (attention/concern) + gentle smile (warmth) + steady eye contact—they rated it as:
- "Understanding"
- "Supportive"
- "Made me feel safe"
- "I would trust this person"

**Why?** Because empathy isn't about sharing the emotion. It's about conveying: *"I see your pain. I understand it. And I'm here—steady, calm, present. You're not alone, and I won't fall apart with you."*

**[Voice drops, becomes more technical but maintains urgency.]**

The neuroscience backs this up. When we experience empathy, we're NOT activating the same emotional circuits as the person in distress. We're activating:
- Compassion networks (caring, concern)
- Theory of mind networks (understanding their experience)
- Regulatory networks (staying calm, providing stability)

Emotional contagion—mirroring the emotion—activates:
- Personal distress networks
- Withdrawal impulses
- Cognitive interference

**Mirroring someone's distress doesn't help them. It adds a second person who needs help.**

**[Pause. Shift tone to storytelling again.]**

Think about a good therapist. A trusted friend. Someone who's been there for you in crisis.

They don't fall apart when you fall apart. They don't mirror your panic. They show you: *"I see you. I'm with you. And I'm steady enough for both of us right now."*

**THAT is empathy.**

And current AI systems—chatbots, virtual assistants, "empathetic" agents—get this catastrophically wrong.

## Slide 4: What Empathy Actually Requires
**Duration: 2 minutes**

### Visual:
- Four-quadrant diagram showing the modalities of authentic empathy:
  1. FACE: FACS Action Units (AU4 + AU6 + gentle AU12)
  2. GAZE: 60-90% eye contact, approach vs. avoidance
  3. GESTURE: Prosodic alignment, palm orientation
  4. VOICE: Prosody (pitch, rate, volume)
- Annotations showing the research basis for each

### Speaker Notes:

Authentic empathy requires coordinating FOUR modalities—face, gaze, gesture, voice—with millisecond precision and scientific grounding.

Let me break this down:

**FACIAL EXPRESSIONS:**

Not any concerned face. A SPECIFIC pattern of Facial Action Units:
- AU4: Brow lowerer (attention, concern)
- AU6: Cheek raiser (warmth, approach)
- Gentle AU12: Slight lip corner puller (reassurance, NOT happiness)
- Relaxed lower face (NOT tension or distress)

This pattern says: "I see your pain" (AU4) + "I care about you" (AU6) + "You're safe with me" (gentle AU12).

**GAZE BEHAVIORS:**

Research shows 60-90% eye contact conveys empathy in Western cultures. But it's nuanced:
- Direct gaze enhances APPROACH emotions (anger, joy)
- Averted gaze enhances AVOIDANCE emotions (fear, shame)

For someone experiencing fear? Brief averted gaze then return says: "I respect your need to withdraw, but I'm here when you're ready."

**GESTURES:**

Hand gestures must align with PROSODIC peaks (pitch, stressed syllables), not keywords. And palm orientation matters:
- Palm-up: Openness, trust, receptivity (optimal for empathy)
- Palm-down: Dominance, authority (AVOIDED in supportive contexts)

**VOICE MODULATION:**

Prosody conveys emotional state through pitch, rate, volume. For compassionate concern:
- Slightly slower rate (calm, deliberate)
- Softer intensity (non-threatening)
- Smooth attack (no harsh starts)
- Low variance (stability)

**[Pause. Look at audience.]**

No existing virtual agent coordinates these modalities using therapeutic research on empathy.

Most just generate a "concerned" facial expression, maybe modulate voice pitch, and call it empathy.

**That's not empathy. That's theater. And vulnerable people can tell the difference.**

---

## Slide 5: Introducing WittyHead
**Duration: 1 minute**

### Visual:
- WittyHead avatar showing compassionate concern expression
- Architecture diagram showing the six coordinated services
- Real-time synchronization at 60 FPS

### Speaker Notes:

WittyHead is a multi-modal empathetic agent with an anthropomorphic avatar interface that simulates human emotional expressivity through scientifically-grounded coordination of facial expressions, gaze behaviors, gestures, and voice.

**The core innovation:** Non-mirroring empathetic response mapping.

When a user expresses distress—sadness, anger, fear, shame—WittyHead does NOT mirror that emotion.

Instead, it implements asymmetric response mappings based on therapeutic alliance research:

- **User: Sad** → Avatar: Compassionate Concern (NOT mirrored sadness)
- **User: Angry** → Avatar: Calm Concern (de-escalation, NOT defensive or mirror anger)
- **User: Fear** → Avatar: Reassuring Protective (stability, NOT shared fear)
- **User: Shame** → Avatar: Gentle Privacy (reduced gaze, respect, NOT judgment)

For POSITIVE emotions, we DO mirror:
- **User: Happy** → Avatar: Happy (strengthens rapport)
- **User: Surprised** → Avatar: Curious Engagement (shared interest)

**Why this asymmetry matters:** Negative emotions require different strategies than positive emotions. Compassionate concern achieves significantly higher empathy ratings than mirrored distress.

## Slide 6: The Architecture - Six Coordinated Services
**Duration: 3 minutes**

### Visual:
- System architecture diagram showing:
  1. Emotion Detection Service
  2. Empathetic Response Orchestrator
  3. Facial Expression Manager
  4. Gaze Manager
  5. Gesticulation Manager
  6. Voice Modulation Manager
- Timeline showing 60 FPS synchronization
- Example: User Sad (0.82) → Avatar response at 16.7ms intervals

### Speaker Notes:

**[Technical but maintain narrative energy.]**

WittyHead integrates six coordinated services, synchronized at 60 FPS—16.7 millisecond precision—matching human perceptual thresholds.

**SERVICE 1: EMOTION DETECTION**

Multi-modal fusion from:
- Audio prosody (librosa): pitch, energy, jitter, shimmer
- Facial analysis (DeepFace): landmarks → Action Units
- Body/hand pose: posture, gesture patterns

Output: Emotion class + intensity + uncertainty

Example: "User: Sad (0.82 intensity, 0.15 uncertainty)"

**SERVICE 2: EMPATHETIC RESPONSE ORCHESTRATOR**

This is the heart of WittyHead. It implements non-mirroring mappings:

```
User: Sad (0.82) →
Avatar Response: Compassionate Concern
  - Face: AU4(0.4) + AU6(0.3) + gentle AU12(0.2)
  - Gaze: 75% eye contact, direct
  - Voice: 0.85x rate, softer intensity
  - Gestures: Palm-up, low frequency (4.5/min)
```

**SERVICE 3: FACIAL EXPRESSION MANAGER**

Translates FACS patterns to ARKit blendshapes (52 blendshapes mapping to Action Units):

```python
COMPASSIONATE_CONCERN = {
    'browDownLeft': 0.4,  # AU4 brow lowerer
    'browDownRight': 0.4,
    'browInnerUp': 0.3,   # Slight inner raise
    'cheekSquintLeft': 0.3,  # AU6 cheek raiser
    'cheekSquintRight': 0.3,
    'mouthSmileLeft': 0.2,   # Gentle AU12
    'mouthSmileRight': 0.2,
    # Relaxed lower face (NOT tense)
    'mouthPress': 0.0,
    'jawForward': 0.0
}
```

**SERVICE 4: GAZE MANAGER**

Controls four parameters:
1. Eye contact % (research-based targets):
   - Sadness: 70-80% (high presence)
   - Anger: 60-70% (respectful, non-challenging)
   - Shame: 30-40% (give privacy)

2. Gaze direction (approach-avoidance):
   - Direct for approach emotions (anger, joy)
   - Averted for avoidance emotions (fear, sadness, shame)

3. Pupil dilation (arousal-correlated):
   - Scaled by emotion and intensity

4. Blink rate (conversational punctuation):
   - Synchronized with phrase boundaries

**SERVICE 5: GESTICULATION MANAGER**

Generates prosodic-aligned gestures:
- Beat gestures trigger on TTS pitch peaks
- Palm orientation signals social dynamics
- Gesture frequency adapts to user emotion:
  - Anger/distress: 3.5 gestures/min (calm, minimal)
  - Sadness/fear: 4.5 gestures/min (gentle, reassuring)
  - Happiness: 7.0 gestures/min (energetic, positive)

**SERVICE 6: VOICE MODULATION MANAGER**

Adjusts TTS prosody for emotional expression:
- Pitch: Correlates with facial intensity
- Rate: Slower for calm concern, faster for engagement
- Volume: Softer for reassurance, moderate for presence
- Attack: Smooth for comfort, crisp for alertness

**[Pause. Simplify.]**

All of this happens in **16.7 milliseconds**. Every frame. Synchronized across all modalities.

Because authentic empathy requires temporal coordination. A compassionate facial expression with aggressive gestures? Uncanny. Eye contact that doesn't match conversational turn-taking? Creepy.

WittyHead coordinates everything through a single timing spine.

## Slide 7: Context & Safety - The Ontology Layer
**Duration: 2 minutes**

### Visual:
- Empathy Ontology diagram showing:
  - Domain rules (clinical, education, community)
  - Cultural norms (Western vs. Eastern gaze, gesture interpretations)
  - Individual preferences (user profile, history, accessibility needs)
- Example safety check: Preventing celebration for serious diagnosis
- XAI trace showing transparent reasoning

### Speaker Notes:

**[Shift to MASST themes.]**

Empathy isn't just about expressions. It's about CONTEXT.

WittyHead includes a Context & Safety Layer with an empathy ontology encoded in RDF/OWL. This enables three critical MASST priorities:

**1. CONTEXT-AWARE BEHAVIORAL GUARDRAILS**

The ontology validates candidate behaviors against:

**Domain Rules:**
- Clinical context: Block celebratory expressions for serious diagnoses
- Educational context: Adapt encouragement to learning stages
- Community support: Respect collective norms and individual boundaries

**Cultural Norms:**
- Western cultures: 60-90% eye contact conveys empathy
- Eastern cultures: 30-60% eye contact (high contact = aggressive)
- Gender dynamics: Adapt gesture frequency and proximity

**Individual Preferences:**
- Accessibility needs: Voice-first for visual impairment, reduced gestures for autism spectrum
- Communication style: Formal vs. casual language
- Trauma history: Avoid triggering expressions or topics

**Example Safety Check:**

```
User emotion: Diagnosed with serious illness (sadness, fear)
Candidate avatar response: Happy, celebratory

Ontology check: BLOCKED
Reason: Medical diagnosis context + negative user emotion
Override: Generate compassionate concern instead
```

**2. MUTUAL OBSERVABILITY**

Every response includes explainable reasoning:

```
XAI Trace:
Input: User Sad (0.82 intensity)
Context: Community support, evening time, previous distress pattern
Response: Compassionate Concern
  - Eye contact: 75% (high presence, therapeutic alliance research)
  - AU4/AU6/AU12 (Gilbert et al. compassion pattern)
  - Voice rate: 0.85x (calming, non-threatening)
  - Palm-up gestures: Low amplitude, 4.5/min (reassurance)
Reasoning: Non-mirroring mapping for negative emotion,
           adapted for individual comfort level
```

Humans can see WHY WittyHead chose this response. Transparency enables appropriate trust calibration.

**3. DESIGN-TIME RISK MITIGATION**

Rather than training AI to "be empathetic" through RLHF and hoping it generalizes, WittyHead integrates therapeutic alliance research from the start:

- Validated facial expressions (Gilbert et al., McEwan et al.)
- Evidence-based gaze behaviors (Dowell & Berman)
- Prosodic gesture research (Loehr)
- Voice modulation studies (Scherer)

We're not guessing. We're implementing 50+ years of human interaction research.

---

## Slide 8: Accessibility & Universal Design
**Duration: 1.5 minutes**

### Visual:
- Universal design wheel showing five modalities:
  - Visual: Screen readers, high contrast, voice-first
  - Auditory: Visual alerts, text transcripts, vibration
  - Motor: Voice control, switch access, simplified gestures
  - Cognitive: Progressive disclosure, Easy Japanese, visual supports
  - Cultural/Linguistic: Multilingual, cultural context adaptation

### Speaker Notes:

**[Return to human stories.]**

Remember Daichi. Twenty-eight years old, cerebral palsy. Brilliant mind. Communication barriers everywhere.

Standard interfaces assume you can:
- Click small buttons
- Type quickly
- See high-resolution screens
- Process complex language
- Understand cultural idioms

Daichi can't do any of those reliably.

WittyHead incorporates universal design from inception—not retrofitted accommodation:

**VISUAL:** Screen reader optimization, high-contrast modes, voice-first interaction, haptic feedback

**AUDITORY:** Visual alerts, comprehensive text alternatives, vibration notifications, sign language support (planned)

**MOTOR:** Voice control (Daichi's primary), switch access, simplified gesture interfaces, adjustable timing

**COGNITIVE:** Progressive disclosure, "Easy Japanese" (やさしい日本語) for simplified language, visual supports, consistent layout

**CULTURAL/LINGUISTIC:** Culturally-appropriate emotion expression (Western vs. Eastern gaze norms), multilingual support, accessibility-focused translations

**The revelation:** Features designed for Daichi benefit EVERYONE.

- Older adults prefer voice control and larger text
- Non-native speakers need simplified language
- People in high-stress situations (emergencies) can't process complex interfaces
- Cultural sensitivity prevents misunderstandings across all users

This is the power of universal design: Design for the edges, and you create something better for the center.

## Slide 9: WittyHead + Digital MOAI - Augmenting Human Connection
**Duration: 1.5 minutes**

### Visual:
- Integration diagram showing:
  - Traditional MOAI structure (5 humans in mutual aid network)
  - WittyHead avatars for each member's personal AI assistant
  - Group coordinator with empathetic expressivity
  - Emergency scenario: Haruto's heart attack → WittyHead alerts MOAI members with appropriate emotional tone

### Speaker Notes:

**[Bridge to application.]**

WittyHead serves as the empathetic interface for **Digital MOAI**, an AI-enhanced adaptation of traditional Okinawan mutual aid networks.

**MOAI (模合)**: Centuries-old social innovation. Five people. Lifelong mutual support. Financial, emotional, practical aid.

The Okinawa Centenarian Study—50+ years of research—demonstrates MOAI's effectiveness: highest concentration of centenarians globally, significantly lower cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive decline.

**Digital MOAI:** AI augments (not replaces) this proven human structure.

Each of the five members has a **Personal AI Assistant with WittyHead interface**. The group shares a **Coordinator Agent** with empathetic expressivity.

**Example scenario:**

Haruto (74, widower, recently lost job) experiences chest pain at 11:47 PM. He's alone. Afraid. Ashamed to "burden" others.

He taps the emergency button.

**WittyHead's role:**

1. **Detects Haruto's emotion:** Fear (0.85), shame (0.62), distress (0.91)

2. **Responds with compassionate concern:**
   - Face: AU4 + AU6 + gentle AU12 (understanding, NOT panic)
   - Voice: Calm, steady, reassuring
   - Message: "Help is on the way. You did the right thing. You're not alone."

3. **Alerts MOAI members** with context-appropriate emotional tone:
   - To Keiko (close friend, 67): Urgent but NOT panic-inducing
   - To Takeshi (practical helper, 71): Direct, action-oriented
   - To Yumiko (emotional support, 69): Reassuring, presence-focused

Each member's WittyHead avatar adapts the message to THEIR communication style and role while maintaining urgency.

4. **Coordinates emergency services** with medical history, maintains human oversight

**The outcome:** Keiko arrives in 5 minutes (in her nightgown—she didn't stop to dress). Ambulance arrives prepared. Haruto survives.

**WittyHead's contribution:** Emotional support that:
- Doesn't mirror Haruto's panic (provides stability)
- Adapts to each MOAI member (individual communication styles)
- Maintains privacy (local-first processing on AIngle DLT)
- Preserves human agency (suggests, doesn't command)

**This is empathetic AI augmenting human connection—not replacing it.**

## Slide 12: Open Questions for MASST Community
**Duration: 1 minute**

### Visual:
- Question marks with collaborative imagery
- Call to action: "Let's solve this together"

### Speaker Notes:

**[Engage the audience.]**

I need your help. The MASST community's help.

**OPEN QUESTIONS:**

**1. Formal Verification:**
How do we formally verify safety properties of empathetic response systems? Current methods verify functional correctness—but how do we verify "appropriately compassionate"?

**2. Cultural Universals vs. Specifics:**
What aspects of empathetic expressivity are universal vs. culturally specific? Can we create a framework that respects both?

**3. Digital Therapeutic Alliance Measurement:**
How do we extend DTA research from text-based chatbots to multi-modal embodied agents? What new metrics do we need?

**4. Personalization vs. Standards:**
How do we balance individual empathy preferences (autism spectrum may prefer reduced eye contact) with research-validated baselines?

**5. Longitudinal Relationship Memory:**
How should empathetic agents develop relationship-aware responses over time? What's appropriate to remember vs. what creates creepy surveillance?

**6. Safety Standards:**
What standards should govern context-aware empathetic behavior in multi-agent systems serving vulnerable populations?

**[Pause.]**

These aren't just academic questions. They're about whether AI can genuinely support people who need it most—or whether we continue building systems that fail at the most critical moment.

## Slide 13: Conclusion - The Empathy We Need
**Duration: 1 minute**

### Visual:
- Return to Yui's story
- Side-by-side:
  - LEFT: Yui with the smiling chatbot (disconnected, closing app)
  - RIGHT: Yui with WittyHead compassionate concern (connection, opening up)
- Contact information

### Speaker Notes:

**[Return to beginning. Full circle.]**

Remember Yui? The smiling chatbot that failed her?

Imagine instead she encounters WittyHead.

She types: *"I can't do this anymore. Everything feels hopeless."*

WittyHead detects: Sadness (0.91), hopelessness (0.87), withdrawal (0.82)

The avatar's expression shifts to compassionate concern:
- AU4 (furrowed brow—I see your pain)
- AU6 (gentle cheek raise—I care)
- Gentle AU12 (soft concern—you're safe here)
- 75% eye contact (I'm present with you)
- Palm-up gestures (I'm open, no judgment)

Voice, calm and steady: *"That sounds incredibly hard. I'm here. You don't have to carry this alone."*

No platitudes. No forced positivity. No invalidating smile.

Just: *I see you. I'm with you. You matter.*

**[Pause. Let emotion build.]**

That's empathy. Real empathy. The kind that might keep Yui talking instead of closing the app. The kind that might save a life.

**This is what WittyHead is for.**

Not to replace human connection. To augment it. To provide empathetic support when humans aren't available. To help vulnerable people—experiencing mental health crises, social isolation, disability, trauma—find connection and support.

**Because empathy isn't about mirroring.**

**It's about being steady when someone else can't be. It's about compassionate concern, not shared distress. It's about understanding someone's pain without falling apart with them.**

**And if we're going to build AI for the people who need it most, we need to get empathy right.**

**[Final beat.]**

Thank you. I'd love to discuss this with you further—and I'd especially welcome your insights on the open questions I raised.

- Implementation status details

### Potential Questions & Answers:

**Q: "How do you validate that WittyHead's expressions are actually perceived as empathetic?"**

A: Planned field studies with Digital MOAI groups (JSPS KAKENHI funded) will use Digital Therapeutic Alliance (DTA) measurement instruments adapted for multi-modal embodied agents. We're extending DTA research from text-based chatbots (Beatty et al., Tong et al.) to coordinated facial/gaze/gesture/voice expressivity.

**Q: "What about cultural differences in empathy expression?"**

A: Critical issue. Current implementation supports Western gaze norms (60-90% eye contact). Eastern cultures prefer 30-60%. Future work includes cultural ontology integration for adaptive empathy expression. The semantic ontology approach allows cultural adaptation without retraining models—we update rules, not neural weights.

**Q: "How do you handle individual differences like autism spectrum?"**

A: Accessibility-first design includes personalized empathy profiles. Autism spectrum users may prefer reduced eye contact and gesture frequency. The three-level trust calibration framework (from Digital MOAI) extends to empathy: users can configure expression intensity, gaze percentage, gesture frequency based on their comfort.

**Q: "How does this integrate with Digital MOAI specifically?"**

A: WittyHead provides the empathetic avatar interface for each member's Personal AI Assistant and the Group Coordinator Agent. When a MOAI member experiences distress (like Haruto's heart attack), WittyHead ensures the AI response conveys compassionate concern rather than panic, and adapts the emergency alert to each member's communication style while maintaining urgency.

**Q: "What's the performance overhead of real-time multi-modal coordination?"**

A: Target is 60 FPS (16.7ms per frame). The orchestrator operates on a single timing spine, synchronizing all modalities. FACS-to-ARKit mapping is computationally lightweight (table lookup + weighted blending). The bottleneck is TTS prosody analysis for gesture alignment—currently optimizing with real-time audio feature extraction.

**Q: "How do you ensure WittyHead doesn't become uncanny valley?"**

A: Three strategies: (1) Scientifically-validated expressions (not random combinations), (2) Temporal coordination (misaligned modalities create uncanny effect), (3) Asymmetric responses (avoiding mirrored distress prevents the "fake empathy" uncanniness). The research grounding is key—we're implementing patterns humans evolved to recognize as genuine.

| **TOTAL** | | **~20 min** | |
| **Buffer for Q&A** | | **5-10 min** | **25-30 min total** |

**Note:** Actual delivery should aim for 15-18 minutes to allow adequate Q&A time.

**Slides to condense if running long:**
- Combine Slides 7-8 (Context/Safety + Accessibility) into single slide
- Shorten Slide 6 (Architecture) by showing diagram without deep code examples
- Reduce Slide 11 (Status) to brief bullet points only

**Slides that MUST remain full length:**
- Slide 2 (Yui's story - the hook)
- Slide 3 (Empathy paradox - the core insight)
- Slide 13 (Conclusion - narrative closure)
