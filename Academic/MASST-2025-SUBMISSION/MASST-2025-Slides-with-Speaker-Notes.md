### SPEAKER NOTES:

**[English]**

"Good morning.

*[Pause. Three heartbeats. Let silence build.]*

Before I tell you about multi-agent systems and privacy-preserving architectures, I want you to **feel** something.

*[Voice drops, intimate, pulling them in]*

**SMELL:** Instant ramen. Cold. The sesame oil has congealed into a film like skin on forgotten milk. It sits on a kitchen table that smells faintly of bleach and, underneath that, something sweeter—Michiko's Shiseido perfume, though she's been gone two years. Grief has a smell. It smells like rooms that used to hold two people, now holding one.

**SIGHT:** The blue-white glow of a phone screen at 11:47 PM, reflecting off cheap laminate. The light catches the edges of an envelope—white, official, corporate. 'Thank you for your service. Economic conditions. We regret...'

**SOUND:** The neighbor's TV through walls thin as rice paper. Game show laughter. Someone else's life. And underneath, Haruto's breathing—shallow, uncertain.

Haruto Tanaka is seventy-four. He wakes to pain. Not sharp—he knows sharp. This spreads like fingers pressing into his chest, squeezing.

In this moment, he makes the calculation all elderly people living alone eventually make:

*Is this nothing? Or is this the end?*

And beneath that: *If I'm wrong, will I prove I'm the burden Michiko warned me not to be?*

*[Pause. Make eye contact.]*

This presentation isn't about technology.

It's about the **three minutes** between Haruto's chest pain starting and help arriving.

It's about whether AI closes that gap—or widens it into a chasm that swallows people whole.

I'm Yuri Tijerino from Kwansei Gakuin University. My colleagues—Dr. Kazuko Kotoku, Dr. Yasushi Miyazaki—we've been asking:

**How do we build AI systems for the people AI most often forgets?**

The answer wasn't in Silicon Valley. It wasn't in neural networks.

It was in Okinawa. In the wrinkled hands of Dr. Kotoku's 96-year-old grandmother, alive through a tradition that's kept people breathing for **500 years.** Your phone is two years old. Your framework is six months old. But trust? Trust built through a social technology so elegant, so proven, that we stopped trying to replace it and started trying to **serve** it.

**THE EXTENDED METAPHOR - Privacy as Oxygen:**

What we're about to show you treats privacy the way your body treats oxygen. You don't appreciate oxygen until it's gone. Until someone's hands are around your throat and you understand: this isn't comfort. This is **survival.** Every breath.

**THE PROMISE:**

For want of connection, the life was lost.
For want of privacy, the family was scattered.
For want of design that sees the edges, the center crumbled.

We're here to show you a different way. Not because we're smarter. Because we learned to be humbler.

Because we listened to the ghosts."

## SLIDE 2: HARUTO'S CRISIS + THE PROBLEM
**Duration: 2 minutes**

### SLIDE CONTENT:

**Left Side - The Crisis:**

# Haruto, 74 | Tokyo
## Living alone after wife's passing

**11:47 PM. Chest pain. Alone. Afraid.**

**What Digital MOAI Does:**
1. ⏱️ Haruto taps "Emergency" (0.16ms response)
2. 📱 AI notifies 4 MOAI members instantly
3. 🏃 Keiko arrives in 5 minutes
4. 🚑 AI coordinates ambulance + medical history
5. 📋 MOAI legal entity handles paperwork
6. 🤝 Group coordinates recovery support

**Outcome:** ✅ Life saved. Dignity preserved.

---

**Right Side - The Problem:**

## Without AI Safety = Catastrophe

**For Vulnerable Populations:**

❌ **Current Multi-Agent Systems:**
- Prioritize efficiency over safety
- Centralized data (privacy risks)
- Lack cultural context
- No human oversight
- Require constant internet

**Three Critical Gaps:**

🚨 **Safety Crisis**
RLHF insufficient for life-or-death decisions

🚨 **Trust Crisis**
Opaque AI with no user control

🚨 **Privacy Crisis**
Centralized storage = existential risks

### VISUAL DESIGN:
- **Top:** Storyboard panels showing Haruto's emergency (6 panels, stick figures + app interface)
- **Bottom:** Split screen: Failed AI scenarios vs. Digital MOAI solution
- **Color coding:** Red for problems, green for solutions

### SPEAKER NOTES:

**[English]**

"Let me take you inside that moment. Not as observers. As Haruto. Let me put his heart in your chest.

**THE SETTING - 5-SENSE IMMERSION:**

**TOUCH:** The table is small—meant for two, set for one. Laminate sticky under his palm. He hasn't cleaned properly since Michiko died. What's the point? The phone is cold like a river stone. The termination letter's paper has the texture of humiliation—thick, expensive, impersonal.

**TASTE:** Bile rising. Metallic adrenaline. The memory of Michiko's miso soup—salty, warm, proof someone cared whether you ate.

**SOUND:** His breath, too fast. The fluorescent light flickers—three months, needs replacing. The wall clock ticks. Each second a decision deferred.

**THE GHOST:**

Michiko's last lucid moment. Lung cancer. Her hand in his—paper-thin, cold. Voice a whisper: 'Don't become a burden, Haruto. Promise me.'

He promised.

Now, every need for help feels like breaking that promise.

**THE CALCULATION:**

The pain radiates from his sternum like cracks in ice. Left arm tingles—textbook cardiac event. He's a retired accountant. He understands probability, risk, consequence.

But knowledge and action are separated by a chasm called fear.

*[Voice becomes his internal monologue—accountant's precision]*

*Left ventricular infarction, probably. 80% chance. Call ambulance. Cost: ¥60,000. Embarrassment if wrong: infinite. Burden on children if right: infinite. Expected value of dying alone with dignity: high. Expected value of living as the old man who cried wolf: low.*

*The numbers don't add up to a decision that doesn't hurt.*

His hand shakes. Not from the heart attack. From the paralysis of being alone with a decision that might kill you either way.

**THE DOOR OPENS:**

But there's something on his phone. Something his daughter set up. Her voice, patient: 'Papa, just one button. Red. That's all. You don't have to be alone.'

He looks at the button. Red. Color of emergency. Color of blood. Color of life.

*[Voice drops, slows—make them feel the weight]*

He taps it.

**WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:**

*0.3 seconds:* The app pulls his medical file from encrypted **local storage.** Not from a cloud server in California—from **his device.** Atrial fibrillation. Warfarin. Penicillin allergy—anaphylaxis. The stent surgery three years ago.

*1.8 seconds:* Four phones light up like fireflies in the Tokyo night.

**Keiko Yamamoto, 67,** apartment 3B. Reading glasses, nightgown, TV remote. She sees the alert. Her heart doesn't calculate. Her heart just knows. She doesn't change clothes. She **runs.**

**Takeshi Suzuki, 71,** three buildings over. Arthritic knees. Pain doesn't matter. Haruto matters.

**Yumiko Tanaka, 69.** Making tea. Drops the kettle. Her granddaughter asks where she's going. 'A friend needs me.' Three years in a MOAI. That's not acquaintance. That's **family.**

**Hiroshi Nakamura, 76.** Walks with a cane from the stroke. Calls emergency services directly. His voice is steady. The AI prepared him with everything to say.

*2.0 seconds:* Emergency services receive a formatted alert. Not 'old man pressed button.'

**Location:** 35.6762°N, 139.6503°E. Third floor, building B, apartment 304. Elevator out. Stairs east side.

**Medical history:** Atrial fibrillation, stent 2022, warfarin, penicillin allergy.

**Situation:** Suspected cardiac event. Patient conscious. MOAI member en route.

**THE TRANSFORMATION:**

Keiko arrives. She's 67. Her knees hurt. She's winded from stairs. None of that matters.

The door is unlocked—the AI asked Haruto: 'Would you like to unlock your door for Keiko?' He tapped yes.

She finds him at the table. Cold ramen. Termination letter. Phone still glowing.

She takes his hand. Her palm is warm, dry, certain. His is cold, trembling like a bird.

'Foolish,' he whispers. The word tastes like shame.

*[Pause. This next line is a key turning in a lock.]*

'You're **here**,' she says. Her hand tightens on his. 'That's what matters. You're here.'

**SUBTEXT:** Being alive is not a burden. Needing help is not failure. You are not a number on a spreadsheet, Haruto. You are a person. And I ran.

**THE SYMBOL - KEIKO'S NIGHTGOWN:**

By the time the ambulance arrives—sirens carving through the Tokyo night—Keiko is still in her nightgown. Floral, faded from washing. No coat. No shoes, just slippers.

The nightgown is the truth: **help doesn't wait for perfection. Help runs.**

The paramedic takes the tablet. Haruto's complete medical history. Current medications. Allergies. The stent. No fumbling. No gaps. No time wasted.

**THE HANDS MOTIF - FIRST ITERATION:**

Haruto's trembling hands that couldn't decide.
Keiko's warm hands that decided for both of them.
The paramedic's gloved hands, competent and quick.
Hands reaching. Hands holding. Hands that save.

Remember these hands. We'll return to them.

**THE SURVIVAL:**

Haruto survives that night.

But understand—**millions like Haruto don't.** Not because technology doesn't exist. Because current AI systems treat people like data points, not like someone's father who still smells his dead wife's perfume and measures his worth by whether he's useful.

Because systems optimize for **average users** in **average situations.**

And Haruto—grieving, elderly, alone, ashamed—is not average.

He's **human.** Which means he's singular. Irreplaceable. Worth the engineering effort to save.

That's not sentiment. That's our design principle.

---

**BUT WITHOUT AI SAFETY...**

*[Voice shifts—harder, colder, urgent. You're angry now.]*

For vulnerable populations, AI failures aren't inconveniences. They're **life sentences.**

**MARIA/SORA - THE GHOST OF DEPORTATION:**

Her name *was* Maria. Now it's Sora. That name change isn't preference. It's survival camouflage.

Twenty-five. The Ikebukuro apartment smells like:
- **Fish** from the 4 AM Tsukiji run
- **Industrial cleaner** that burns your nostrils
- **Exhaustion**—you can smell it on sleep-deprived bodies

**THE GHOST:** Not herself. Her friend Maria. Same situation. Different ending.

Maria worked two jobs. Early shift at family restaurant—smile at customers who call you 'hey' because they don't think you have a name. Late shift cleaning offices—vacuum carpets where executives make in an hour what you make in a month.

Thirteen-hour days. The money goes home to the Philippines. Every yen. Mother's diabetes medication (¥18,000/month). Brother's school fees (¥12,000/term).

**THE AI-POWERED NONPROFIT:**

She needs help. The eviction notice is taped to her door. Three days.

She finds a nonprofit. Gleaming website. Professional. **'AI-powered assistance for immigrant communities. We're here to help.'**

Friendly interface. Pastel colors. Gentle fonts. It asks for everything. She uploads everything.

Because what choice does she have?

**THE BREACH:**

Six months later, the database is breached. Sold to Immigration enforcement for ¥500,000. The price of Maria's life and 3,000 others.

They take her on a Tuesday morning. 6:47 AM. Walking from 7-Eleven with coffee and two rice balls for her children's breakfast.

**In her purse: ¥3,200.** Not a round number. The specific mathematics of a life interrupted.

Her children—**born in Japan, Japanese citizens**—watch their mother put into a van. Eight and six. They don't understand why mama is going away.

**THE AFTERMATH:**

Maria is in Manila. Call center. Earns in a month what she made in a week.

Her children are in foster care. **Separated.** Different families.

The nonprofit issued an apology: **'We have upgraded our security protocols.'**

*[Pause. Let anger show. Let silence accuse.]*

The nonprofit meant well. And Maria's children wake up in strange beds calling for a mother who's 3,000 kilometers away.

**THE PROBLEM CRYSTALLIZED:**

Current multi-agent systems have **three critical gaps:**

**1. Safety Crisis:** RLHF alone is insufficient for life-or-death decisions.

**2. Trust Crisis:** Opaque AI decision-making with no user control.

**3. Privacy Crisis:** Centralized storage creates existential risks. For Sora, for Sakura, for anyone whose data in the wrong hands means deportation, violence, erasure.

**Privacy isn't a feature. For Sora, it's oxygen.**

You don't appreciate oxygen until someone's hands are around your throat.

Then you understand: this isn't about comfort. This is about **survival.** Every breath."

## SLIDE 3: THE INSPIRATION - 500 YEARS
**Duration: 1 minute**

### SLIDE CONTENT:

# MOAI (模合)
## Okinawa's 500-Year-Old Social Innovation

**The Structure:**

🔢 **Exactly 5 people** (no more, no less)
💫 **Lifelong commitment** to mutual support
💰 **Financial + Emotional + Practical** aid
🤝 **Collective governance** of all decisions

---

**The Evidence:**

📊 **Okinawa Centenarian Study (1975-present)**
- World's longest-running longevity research
- Highest concentration of centenarians globally
- Significantly lower cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive decline

**The Secret:** Social connectedness through MOAI structures

---

**Key Insight:**

> *"What if we augmented—not replaced—this proven system with AI?"*

### VISUAL DESIGN:
- **Left:** Photo of traditional Okinawan MOAI group (5 elderly people)
- **Center:** Longevity statistics infographic (charts showing Okinawa vs. global averages)
- **Right:** "The 5-Person Magic Number" diagram showing constellation pattern
- **Bottom:** Timeline showing 1500-2025 (500 years of proven effectiveness)

---

### SPEAKER NOTES:

**[English]**

"So where do we start? Not with newer AI. Not with bigger models. Not with more data.

We start with **500 years of proven success.**

*[Voice shifts—wonder, respect, humility]*

**MOAI (模合)** - Okinawa's centuries-old social innovation.

**THE STRUCTURE:**

**Exactly 5 people.** Not 4. Not 6. Five. There's magic in that number. Small enough to know each other's breathing patterns. Large enough to survive when one person stumbles.

**Think of it as a constellation.** Not a network—too industrial. Not a web—too fragile. A constellation. Five points of light, close enough to see each other breathe, far enough to have their own orbit.

**Lifelong commitment** to mutual support. Not transactional. Not conditional. You don't quit your MOAI because you had a bad week. You show up *because* someone's having a bad week.

**Financial + Emotional + Practical aid.** Your rent. Your grief. Your broken refrigerator. All of it matters. All of it's covered.

**Collective governance.** Five voices, equal weight. No CEO. No hierarchy. Just five humans deciding together.

**THE EVIDENCE:**

This isn't folklore. This is **science.**

The **Okinawa Centenarian Study**—1975 to present. World's longest-running longevity research.

Okinawa has the highest concentration of centenarians **globally.** People living past 100 at rates that break actuarial tables.

Significantly lower rates of:
- Cardiovascular disease
- Cancer
- Cognitive decline

What's the secret? Genetics? Diet? Climate?

The researchers kept circling back to one answer: **social connectedness through MOAI structures.**

*[Voice drops, becomes intimate]*

Five people who know you. Who check on you. Who notice when your light dims.

Five people who run in their nightgowns when you press a red button.

**THE QUESTION:**

Dr. Kotoku's grandmother is 96. Sharp as a knife. She's been in her MOAI for **74 years.** Seventy-four. Some of you weren't born when her MOAI formed.

And she asked us a question that changed everything:

*'If this has worked for 500 years, why would you replace it? Why not **help** it?'*

*[Pause. Let that land.]*

So we stopped trying to build AI that replaces human connection.

We started building AI that **serves** it.

**THE EXTENDED METAPHOR - Trust as Architecture:**

Trust isn't code you write. It's architecture you inhabit.

Traditional MOAI is a house with five rooms, five people, walls thick enough for secrets but doors open for emergencies.

You don't optimize a house for efficiency. You build it for **living in.**

**THE KEY INSIGHT:**

What if we augmented—not replaced—this proven system with AI?

What if we embedded cutting-edge multi-agent systems **inside** a social structure that's been keeping people alive since 1500?

What if safety emerged not from training AI to be safe in isolation, but from embedding AI in communities that **already know how to care?**

That's the paradigm shift.

That's Digital MOAI."

🚨 **Emergency Response Coordinator**

---

# Five Real MOAIs

**1. Shinrai MOAI (信頼 - Trust)**
Focus: Elderly care | Persona: Haruto, 74

**2. Mirai MOAI (未来 - Future)**
Focus: Disability support | Persona: Daichi, 28

**3. Kibou MOAI (希望 - Hope)**
Focus: Hikikomori | Persona: Yui, 22

**4. Yuiitsu MOAI (唯一 - Unique)**
Focus: LGBTQ+ support | Persona: Sakura, 31

**5. Jiyuu MOAI (自由 - Freedom)**
Focus: Housing insecurity | Persona: Sora, 25

> *Privacy-preserving local data = support without deportation risk*

### VISUAL DESIGN:
- **Center:** Network diagram showing 5 humans with personal AIs and shared agents
- **Surrounding:** Five persona cards with photos, names, key scenarios
- **Color coding:** Each MOAI has distinct color (Trust=blue, Future=green, Hope=yellow, Unique=purple, Freedom=orange)

---

### SPEAKER NOTES:

**[English - Full speaker notes with all 5 personas detailed]**

"So what does this look like in practice?

**Traditional MOAI (Preserved):**
- 5 human members who meet regularly
- Collectively govern every AI decision
- Privacy by design—5-person limit means surveillance-scale data collection is **impossible**

**AI Augmentation (Added):**

Each member gets a **Personal AI Assistant.** Not one AI for all five. Five AIs, one per person. Because Haruto's needs aren't Daichi's needs aren't Yui's needs.

The AI learns:
- Your accessibility requirements (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive)
- Your communication style (Haruto prefers formal Japanese, Yui prefers casual text)
- Your automation comfort level (suggestion only vs. automatic with notification)

Shared **Group Coordinator Agent** that:
- Schedules meetings (with accessibility requirements)
- Monitors well-being patterns (with permission)
- Supports decisions (never replaces them)

**Accessibility Agent** that:
- Dynamically adapts the interface
- Ensures WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance
- Works across modalities

**Emergency Response Coordinator:**
- Instant group notification (0.16ms latency)
- Privacy-preserving location sharing (opt-in, time-limited)
- Medical record coordination (from local storage, not cloud)

**THE FIVE REAL MOAIs:**

These aren't theoretical. These are real personas based on real vulnerabilities.

**1. Shinrai MOAI (信頼 - Trust) - Haruto, 74**
You've met Haruto. The medical emergency. The cold ramen. Keiko's nightgown. Hands that save.

**2. Mirai MOAI (未来 - Future) - Daichi, 28**
Focus: Disability support, accessibility

Daichi has cerebral palsy. His speech is affected—not his mind, his **speech.** And the world conflates the two constantly.

He uses **voice control + simplified gestures** as primary input. Not accommodation. Design.

And here's the thing: **features designed for Daichi became preferred by older users too.**

Voice control isn't just accessibility. It's **universal design.** It makes the system better for **everyone.**

**3. Kibou MOAI (希望 - Hope) - Yui, 22**
Focus: Hikikomori, social withdrawal

For Yui, the door to her room weighs **1000kg.** Only she can see it. Only she can feel it.

She's been isolated for two years. Six tatami mats—approximately 10 square meters. A parking space. That's her world.

**The Ghost:** At 14, she had a panic attack in class. Her classmates filmed it. Posted it online. 47,000 views. 'Crazy Yui.'

The outside world isn't opportunity. It's **freefall without a parachute.**

**The Scenario:** Digital-first engagement. No pressure. AI learns her comfort levels.

The door is still heavy. But now Yui knows: on the other side, five people wait. Not to judge. Just to see her.

**4. Yuiitsu MOAI (唯一 - Unique) - Sakura, 31**
Focus: LGBTQ+ support, safety

Sakura is seven years into transition. Her true self finally visible—and therefore **vulnerable.**

**The Ghost:** A database breach connected her **deadname to her legal name** in search results. Forever.

The violence was swift: housing discrimination, employment termination, doxxing, death threats.

**The Scenario:** Yuiitsu MOAI legal entity secures emergency housing. **Sakura's name never appears on the lease.** Privacy protecting truth instead of truth destroying privacy.

**5. Jiyuu MOAI (自由 - Freedom) - Sora, 25**
Focus: Housing insecurity, undocumented immigrants

Her name was Maria. Now it's Sora. Name change as survival camouflage.

**The Ghost:** Maria. The friend. The database breach. ¥3,200 in her purse. Children in foster care. Separated.

**The Scenario:** Jiyuu MOAI legal entity signs apartment lease. Landlord knows the entity, not Sora's immigration status.

**For Sora, privacy isn't a feature. It's oxygen.**

---

**THE LEGAL INNOVATION:**

Each MOAI is **legally incorporated.** It has legal personhood. It can:
- Hold assets (emergency fund)
- Enter contracts (insurance, housing leases)
- Interact with systems that require organizational identity

**Members remain private.**

This isn't just technical innovation. It's **legal architecture** designed to protect the vulnerable."

## SLIDE 6: FOUR CORE PRINCIPLES
**Duration: 1 minute**

### SLIDE CONTENT:

# Four Core Design Principles

**1. Human Primacy 👥**
AI augments, never replaces, human relationships
*Example: AI suggests, MOAI members vote*

**2. Accessibility First ♿**
Universal design from day one, not retrofitted
*Example: Daichi's voice control benefits everyone*

**3. Privacy Sovereignty 🔒**
Users control 100% of their data
*Example: Sora's status never leaves device*

**4. Cultural Context-Awareness 🌏**
Respect diverse norms through semantic reasoning
*Example: AI adapts formal/casual Japanese naturally*

> *"These aren't features—they're foundational requirements"*

### VISUAL DESIGN:
- Four pillars/columns supporting "Digital MOAI" structure
- Each pillar has icon + title + example
- Real-world photos for each example
- High contrast, accessible design

---

### SPEAKER NOTES:

**[English]**

"Everything I've shown you rests on four principles. These aren't features. They're **foundational requirements.** Compromise one, the system fails. Fail vulnerable people.

**1. HUMAN PRIMACY 👥**

AI **augments,** never replaces, human relationships and decision-making.

*[Voice firm, clear]*

AI suggests. Humans decide.

Haruto's emergency: AI notified the MOAI, coordinated information. But **Keiko ran.** Keiko held his hand. Keiko said "you're here, that matters."

The AI didn't save Haruto. **Keiko saved Haruto.** The AI made it possible for her to arrive in time with the information she needed.

That distinction is everything.

**Example:** AI suggests emergency fund request for Haruto's medication costs (¥45,000). But all five MOAI members **vote** to approve. AI tracks the vote, processes the disbursement, updates records. But the **decision** is human.

All critical decisions require human approval. The group governs AI behavior collectively.

**2. ACCESSIBILITY FIRST ♿**

Universal design from day one, not retrofitted accommodation.

*[Voice passionate—this matters personally]*

We didn't build the system and then ask "how do we make this accessible?" We asked "how do we design this **with** the disability community from day one?"

There's a difference. Accommodation is retrofitting. Universal design is **foundation.**

**Example:** Daichi uses voice control + simplified gestures. Cerebral palsy affects his speech patterns—AI **learns his rhythm, his pace, his voice.** Not asking him to accommodate the system. The system accommodates **him.**

And then we discovered: **older users prefer Daichi's features too.** Voice control when hands are arthritic. Simplified gestures when fine motor control is hard.

Features designed for accessibility benefit **everyone.** That's not charity. That's good engineering. That's **universal design.**

**3. PRIVACY SOVEREIGNTY 🔒**

Users control 100% of their data. No exceptions. No compromises.

*[Voice drops, becomes intense]*

For Sora, privacy isn't a feature. It's **oxygen.**

You don't appreciate oxygen until someone's hands are around your throat.

**Local-first architecture:**
- All personal data stored on **user's device only**
- Peer-to-peer synchronization **within MOAI only**
- Zero-knowledge design
- **No central server to breach**

Maria's database breach doesn't happen in Digital MOAI. Because there's **no central database.**

**Example:** Sora's immigration status never leaves her device. The Jiyuu MOAI legal entity can sign an apartment lease without exposing Sora's personal data.

Privacy enabling participation. Privacy as **access architecture.**

**4. CULTURAL CONTEXT-AWARENESS 🌏**

Respect diverse norms, values, communication styles through semantic reasoning.

*[Voice becomes warm, inclusive]*

Culture isn't decoration. It's **structure.** How you greet someone. How you ask for help. What silence means.

AI that doesn't understand cultural context is AI that causes harm.

**Example:** Haruto prefers formal Japanese because his generation equates formality with respect. Yui prefers casual text because formality feels like performance. AI adapts **naturally,** without asking them to configure preferences.

---

**THE FOUNDATION:**

These four principles are **load-bearing walls.** Remove one, the structure collapses.

Human primacy without accessibility = exclusion.
Accessibility without privacy = surveillance.
Privacy without cultural context = unusable.
Cultural context without human primacy = AI making decisions it shouldn't.

**All four. Non-negotiable. Foundational.**"

**Level 1: Suggestion Only** (default)
AI proposes → waits for approval

**Level 2: Automatic + Notification**
AI acts → 24hr undo window

**Level 3: Automatic + Escalation**
AI acts independently → escalates anomalies

**Group consensus required for all policies**

---

# Accessibility

**👁️ Visual:** Screen readers, high-contrast, voice-first
**👂 Auditory:** Visual alerts, text transcripts, vibration
**🤚 Motor:** Voice control, switch access, large targets
**🧠 Cognitive:** Progressive disclosure, Easy Japanese
**🌏 Cultural:** Bilingual, cultural context, style preferences

### VISUAL DESIGN:

## SLIDE 8: PRIVACY & LEGAL INNOVATION
**Duration: 1.5 minutes**

### SLIDE CONTENT:

# Privacy & Legal Innovation

**The Challenge:**
Centralized data = existential risks

- **Sora:** Deportation (undocumented)
- **Sakura:** Discrimination (transgender)
- **Yui:** Stigma (mental health)
- **Haruto:** Scams (elderly)

---

**The Solution:**

**1. Legal Incorporation**
Each MOAI has legal personhood
- Hold assets (emergency fund)
- Enter contracts (insurance, leases)
- Members remain private

*Example: Jiyuu MOAI signs lease for Sora*

**2. Local-First Architecture**
- Data on user's device only
- P2P sync within MOAI
- No central server to breach

**3. Privacy Features**
- Location: opt-in, time-limited, MOAI-only
- Medical: encrypted, user-controlled
- Financial: via legal entity

**4. Offline Operation**
Works without internet

> *"Privacy isn't a feature. For Sora, it's oxygen."*

### VISUAL DESIGN:
- **Left:** Centralized architecture with breach points marked (X's showing vulnerabilities)
- **Right:** Digital MOAI distributed architecture (shields showing protection)
- **Bottom:** Quote with Maria's ¥3,200 detail

## SLIDE 9: THE PARADIGM SHIFT
**Duration: 1.5 minutes**

### SLIDE CONTENT:

# From "Making AI Safe" to "Making Humans Safe WITH AI"

**Traditional Approach:**
Train AI to be safe → Deploy → Hope it works

**Problems:** Can't anticipate all edge cases, no cultural context, no accountability, privacy risks

---

**Digital MOAI Approach:**
Embed AI in proven structures → Safety emerges from social constraints

**Traditional MOAI Provides:**
✅ 500 years proven effectiveness
✅ Built-in accountability (5-person trust)
✅ Natural privacy constraints
✅ Cultural context and norms
✅ Human oversight always present

**AI Augmentation Adds:**
✅ Real-time coordination (0.16ms)
✅ Accessibility features
✅ Emergency response
✅ Semantic reasoning
✅ Offline capabilities

---

# Five Lives Changed

**Without Digital MOAI → With Digital MOAI**

1. **Haruto:** Alone, 30% higher mortality → Help in 5 min
2. **Sora:** Evicted, deportation risk → Housing secured
3. **Yui:** 2+ years isolation → Re-integrated in 8 months
4. **Daichi:** Can't attend events → Full participation
5. **Sakura:** Violence, discrimination → Safe housing

### VISUAL DESIGN:
- **Top:** Two-path flowchart converging on "Safe Community Support"
- **Bottom:** Five mini case-study cards (before/after)
- Use green checkmarks and red X's for visual contrast

## SLIDE 11: LESSONS + FUTURE WORK
**Duration: 1 minute**

### SLIDE CONTENT:

# What We Learned

💡 **Human Primacy is Non-Negotiable**
Early AI autonomy felt "creepy"

💡 **Accessibility Benefits Everyone**
Daichi's voice control preferred by older users

💡 **Privacy Enables Participation**
Sora and Sakura wouldn't join without local-first

💡 **5-Person Limit is a Feature**
Small scale creates trust—proliferate MOAIs, don't bloat

💡 **Offline-First is Essential**
Internet assumption excludes vulnerable

> *"Building for vulnerable populations requires humility—they're the experts"*

### SPEAKER NOTES:

**[English]**

"This presentation tells a story in 15 minutes. But it's a story that took 500 years to write. We're just adding a chapter.

The ghosts—Michiko, Maria, the classroom video, the database breach—haunt us. They should. They remind us what's at stake.

The hands—trembling, warm, gloved, reaching—guide us. They show us what care looks like.

The doors—1000kg, red buttons, unlocked entrances—teach us. They prove that agency and support aren't opposites. They're partners.

And the five—Haruto, Yui, Sora, Daichi, Sakura—**they** are the measure. Not metrics. Not benchmarks. Not TPS or latency.

Them. Human. Singular. Irreplaceable.

Worth every line of code.
Worth every design decision.
Worth everything.

That's not sentiment.

That's our North Star.

Thank you."
