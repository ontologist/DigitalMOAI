## Slide 2: Meet Haruto - When Technology Meets Crisis

**Haruto, 74 years old**
**Tokyo, Japan**
**Living alone after wife's passing**

**The Crisis:**
Late one evening, Haruto experiences chest pains. He's alone. Afraid. Confused about whether to call an ambulance.

**What Happens Next:**
1. Haruto taps "Emergency" in Digital MOAI app
2. AI instantly notifies his 4 Shinrai MOAI members
3. Keiko (neighbor, 5 min away) receives alert, rushes over
4. AI assistant contacts ambulance with Haruto's medical history
5. By the time paramedics arrive, Keiko is there, medical records ready
6. MOAI's legal entity handles hospital paperwork

**The Outcome:**
Haruto receives immediate treatment. His MOAI group coordinates hospital visits, meal delivery, and emotional support during recovery.

**Visual:** Storyboard sequence showing Haruto's emergency scenario with app screenshots overlaid

**Key Question:** *"How do we build AI systems that save lives while preserving human dignity?"*

---

## Slide 3: The Problem - Current AI Fails Vulnerable Populations

**Why Haruto's Story Matters:**

For vulnerable populations, **AI failures aren't inconveniences—they're catastrophes.**

**❌ Current Multi-Agent Systems:**
- Prioritize **efficiency over safety**
- Use **centralized data** (privacy risks for immigrants, LGBTQ+, abuse survivors)
- Lack **cultural context** and accessibility
- Provide **no human oversight** in critical moments
- Require **constant internet** (impossible in disasters/underserved areas)

**The Three Critical Gaps:**

**Safety Crisis**
RLHF alone insufficient for life-or-death decisions

**Trust Crisis**
Opaque AI decision-making with no user control

**Privacy Crisis**
Centralized storage = existential risks for vulnerable groups

**Visual:** Split screen - Left: Failed AI scenarios (missed emergencies, privacy breaches); Right: DigitalMOAI solution preview

**Quote:** *"Without addressing these through ground-up safety design, multi-agent systems risk more harm than benefit"*

## Slide 11: Four Core Design Principles

**Non-Negotiable Foundations**

**1. Human Primacy** 👥
- AI **augments**, never replaces, human relationships
- All critical decisions require human approval
- Group governs AI behavior collectively

**Example:** AI suggests emergency fund request, but MOAI members vote to approve

**2. Accessibility First** ♿
- Universal design from day one, not retrofitted
- Multiple modalities: visual, auditory, motor, cognitive
- "Easy Japanese" for non-native speakers and cognitive disabilities
- Voice-first option for vision impairments

**Example:** Daichi (cerebral palsy) uses voice control + simplified gestures

**3. Privacy Sovereignty** 🔒
- Users control 100% of their data
- No central authority required
- Local-first architecture
- Quantum-resistant identity (planned)

**Example:** Sora's immigration status never leaves their device

**4. Cultural Context-Awareness** 🌏
- Respect diverse norms, values, communication styles
- Semantic reasoning about cultural appropriateness

## Slide 12: Trust Calibration - User Control

**Three Automation Levels (User-Configured)**

**Level 1: Suggestion Only** (default, high-stakes)
- ✋ AI proposes actions with full transparency
- ⏸️ Waits for explicit human approval
- 🔍 Shows complete reasoning chain
- **Use case:** Medical decisions, emergency fund requests

**Example:** *"Haruto's vitals concerning. Suggest contacting doctor? [Approve] [Modify] [Decline]"*

**Level 2: Automatic with Notification** (routine tasks)
- ⚡ AI takes predefined actions
- 📢 Immediate notification to user
- ⏮️ 24-hour undo window (configurable)
- **Use case:** Meeting reminders, activity scheduling

**Example:** *"Added you to Saturday cleanup event. [Undo] [Modify attendance]"*

**Level 3: Automatic with Escalation** (experienced users)
- 🤖 AI acts independently for routine tasks
- 🚨 Immediately escalates anomalies
- 🔺 High-risk situations require approval
- **Use case:** Regular check-ins, routine communications

**Example:** AI handles weekly wellness check, but escalates if Yui misses 3 in a row

**Group Consensus Required**
All 5 MOAI members collectively decide automation policies

**Visual:** Sliding scale with three levels, showing use cases and examples for each

**Quote:** *"Trust isn't binary—it's calibrated through experience, transparency, and user control"*

## Slide 21: Lessons Learned

**What Building Digital MOAI Taught Us**

**💡 Human Primacy is Non-Negotiable**
Early prototypes with more AI autonomy felt "creepy" to users. Pulling back to suggestion-only default built trust.

**💡 Accessibility Benefits Everyone**
Features designed for Daichi (voice control, simplified gestures) became preferred by older users too.

**💡 Privacy Enables Participation**
Sora and Sakura wouldn't join without local-first architecture. Privacy = access for vulnerable populations.

**💡 Legal Entity is Critical**
Technical platform alone insufficient. Legal personhood enables MOAIs to interact with systems (housing, insurance) that require organizational identity.

**💡 Cultural Context Can't Be Retrofitted**
Early "translation" approach failed. Needed semantic ontology understanding cultural nuance, not just vocabulary.

**💡 5-Person Limit is a Feature, Not a Bug**
Pressure to "scale" with larger groups, but small scale is what creates trust and privacy. Proliferate MOAIs, don't bloat them.

**💡 Offline-First is Essential**
Internet connectivity assumption excludes most vulnerable. Offline-first means disaster resilience AND equity.

**Visual:** Lightbulb icons with key insight statements

**Honest Reflection:**
*"Building for vulnerable populations requires humility—they're the experts on their needs, we're just technologists"*

Not theoretical—actual people facing life-or-death consequences from AI decisions

**2. Implemented Architecture**
Not a paper design—production-ready platform with verified performance

**3. Novel Safety Paradigm**
Challenges assumption that AI must be trained to be safe in isolation

**4. Interdisciplinary Integration**
Combines traditional knowledge (Okinawan MOAI), disability studies (Miyazaki), nursing research (Kotoku), and computer science (AIngle DLT)

**5. Open Questions**
Highlights gaps in current MASST frameworks: How do we verify safety in bio-inspired consensus? What standards for cultural context-awareness?

**6. Demonstration Value**

### Demo Strategy
**Primary Demo (if time permits in main talk):**
Emergency scenario walkthrough (2-3 minutes)
- Show Haruto tapping emergency button
- Display real-time MOAI notifications
- Demonstrate AI coordination with emergency services
- Show post-emergency support coordination

**Backup Demo (during breaks):**
Full application walkthrough
- Onboarding flow
- Dashboard features
- Accessibility adaptations
- Privacy controls

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: "How do you handle consensus when MOAI members disagree?"**
A: Three-tier decision system: (1) Personal AI settings = individual autonomy, (2) Routine tasks = majority vote, (3) Critical decisions = unanimous or escalate to human discussion. Remember: AI suggests, humans decide.

**Q: "What if vulnerable person doesn't have 4 others to form MOAI?"**
A: Matchmaking system (in development) connects individuals with shared needs/interests while preserving privacy. Alternative: join existing MOAI with open spot (rare, as MOAIs tend to be stable).

**Q: "Privacy sounds great, but what about backups? Data loss?"**
A: Encrypted peer-to-peer replication across MOAI members' devices. Each member holds encrypted copy of group data. No single point of failure. IPFS integration for larger media files.

**Q: "Cultural adaptation beyond Japan?"**
A: Semantic ontology designed for cultural extensibility. Working with anthropologists to map community support structures globally (Korean "kye", African "susu", Caribbean "sou-sou"). Core principle: preserve local structures, add AI augmentation.

**Q: "Performance seems too good (0.16ms). What's the catch?"**
A: Local-first architecture means no network latency for core operations. 0.16ms is local semantic query time. P2P sync across MOAI members adds latency (typically <100ms on LAN), but non-blocking for user operations.

**Q: "How do you prevent AI from becoming 'too good' and replacing human judgment?"**
A: Design constraint: Default automation level is "suggestion only." Users must explicitly opt into automation. Group consensus required to change policies. Regular human meetings remain central to MOAI structure.

**Q: "Verification of safety claims?"**
A: Currently empirical verification through testing (2M+ operations). Seeking collaboration on formal verification methods for bio-inspired consensus. Open research question for MASST community!

**Q: "Scalability concerns - can this work beyond 5-person groups?"**
A: Intentionally doesn't scale past 5. Instead: proliferate MOAIs. Network effects through inter-MOAI coordination (planned), but core units remain small for trust and privacy.
