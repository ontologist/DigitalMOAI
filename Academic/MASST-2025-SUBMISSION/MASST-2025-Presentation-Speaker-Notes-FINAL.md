## Slide 1: Title - Opening the Door

**Speaker Notes (English):**

"Good morning. Before I tell you about our research, I want you to feel something.

*[Pause. Three heartbeats. Let silence build like water behind a dam.]*

**SMELL:** Instant ramen. Cold. The sesame oil has congealed into a film. Forgotten on a kitchen table that smells faintly of bleach and, underneath that, something sweeter—Michiko's Shiseido perfume, though she's been gone two years. Grief has a smell. It smells like rooms that used to hold two people, now holding one.

**SIGHT:** The blue-white glow of a phone screen reflecting off cheap laminate at 11:47 PM. The light catches the edges of an envelope—white, official, corporate letterhead. 'Thank you for your service. Economic conditions. We regret...'

**SOUND:** The neighbor's TV through walls thin as rice paper. Game show laughter. Someone else's life, muffled and distant. And underneath that, Haruto's breathing—shallow, uncertain.

Haruto Tanaka wakes to pain. Not sharp—he's lived seventy-four years, he knows sharp. This is different. This spreads like fingers pressing into his chest, squeezing. Like gravity reversed, pulling inward instead of down.

His children's voices are recordings on his phone. Osaka is only three hours away by train. It might as well be the moon.

**THE CORE WOUND:** Obsolescence. The terror of becoming useless, invisible. Michiko's last words to him haunt every decision: 'Don't become a burden to the children.' So he carries his loneliness like a stone in his chest—right next to where the pain is spreading now.

In this moment, Haruto makes the calculation all elderly people living alone eventually make:

*Is this nothing? Or is this the end?*

And beneath that calculation, the deeper fear: *If I call for help and I'm wrong, will I prove I'm the burden Michiko warned me not to be?*

*[Pause. Make eye contact. Let them see the weight.]*

This presentation isn't about technology.

It's about the three minutes between Haruto's chest pain starting and help arriving.

It's about whether artificial intelligence can close that gap—or whether it will widen it into a chasm that swallows people whole.

I'm Yuri Tijerino from Kwansei Gakuin University. My colleagues—Dr. Kazuko Kotoku from Fukuoka University and Dr. Yasushi Miyazaki—we've been asking one question that haunts us like Michiko's perfume haunts Haruto's apartment:

**How do we build AI systems for the people AI most often forgets?**

The answer wasn't in Silicon Valley. It wasn't buried in neural networks or hidden in transformer architectures.

It was in Okinawa. In the wrinkled hands of Dr. Kotoku's 96-year-old grandmother, alive and vibrant through a tradition that's kept people breathing for 500 years. Five hundred. Your phone is two years old. Your framework is six months old. But trust? Trust built through a social technology so elegant, so proven, that we stopped trying to replace it and started trying to *serve* it.

**THE EXTENDED METAPHOR - Privacy as Oxygen:**

What we're about to show you treats privacy the way your body treats oxygen. You don't appreciate oxygen until it's gone. Until someone's hands are around your throat and you understand: this isn't about comfort. This is about survival. Every breath.

**THE PROMISE:**

For want of connection, the life was lost. For want of privacy, the family was scattered. For want of design that sees the edges, the center crumbled.

We're here to show you a different way. Not because we're smarter. Because we learned to be humbler. Because we listened to the ghosts."

**発表者ノート（日本語）:**

「おはようございます。私たちの研究についてお話しする前に、何かを感じてほしいのです。

*[間を取る。3つの心拍。ダムの後ろの水のように沈黙を築く。]*

**匂い:** インスタントラーメン。冷たい。ごま油が膜に凝固しています。キッチンテーブルの上に忘れられている。テーブルはかすかに漂白剤の匂いがし、その下に何か甘いもの—美智子さんの資生堂の香水。彼女が亡くなって2年経っているのに。悲しみには匂いがあります。かつて2人を抱いていた部屋の匂い、今は1人を抱いている。

**視覚:** 午後11時47分、安っぽいラミネートに反射するスマートフォンの青白い輝き。光は封筒の端を捉えます—白、公式、企業のレターヘッド。「ご尽力ありがとうございました。経済状況。残念ながら...」

**音:** 和紙のように薄い壁を通した隣人のテレビ。ゲーム番組の笑い声。他の誰かの人生、こもって遠い。そしてその下に、ハルトの呼吸—浅く、不確か。

田中ハルトは痛みで目を覚まします。鋭いものではありません—彼は74年生きてきました、鋭いを知っています。これは違います。これは指が胸を押し、絞るように広がります。重力が逆転したように、下ではなく内側に引っ張ります。

子供たちの声は電話の録音です。大阪は電車でたった3時間。月と同じくらい遠い。

**核心的な傷:** 時代遅れ。役に立たなくなること、見えなくなることの恐怖。美智子さんの最後の言葉がすべての決定を悩ませます：「子供たちの負担にならないで。」だから彼は孤独を胸の石のように運びます—今痛みが広がっているすぐ隣に。

この瞬間、ハルトは一人暮らしのすべての高齢者がいつかする計算をします：

*これは何でもない？それとも、これが終わり？*

そしてその計算の下に、より深い恐怖：*もし助けを呼んで間違っていたら、美智子さんが警告した負担であることを証明することになるのか？*

*[間を取る。アイコンタクト。重みを見せる。]*

このプレゼンテーションは技術についてではありません。

ハルトの胸の痛みが始まってから助けが到着するまでの3分間についてです。

人工知能がその隙間を閉じることができるのか、それとも人々を丸ごと飲み込む深淵に広げるのか、についてです。

私は関西学院大学のティヘリノ　ジュリです。私の同僚—福岡大学の神徳和子教授と宮崎康教授—私たちを悩ませる一つの問いを追求してきました。美智子さんの香水がハルトのアパートを悩ませるように：

**AIが最もよく忘れる人々のためのAIシステムをどう構築するか？**

答えはシリコンバレーにはありませんでした。ニューラルネットワークの中に埋もれても、トランスフォーマーアーキテクチャの中に隠されてもいませんでした。

それは沖縄にありました。神徳教授の96歳の祖母のしわの寄った手の中に。500年間人々を呼吸させ続けてきた伝統を通じて、生き生きと活発に。500年。あなたの電話は2歳です。あなたのフレームワークは6ヶ月です。しかし信頼は？非常にエレガントで、非常に証明された社会技術を通じて構築された信頼、私たちはそれを置き換えようとすることを止め、それに*奉仕*しようとし始めました。

**拡張された比喩 - 酸素としてのプライバシー:**

私たちがこれからお見せするものは、あなたの体が酸素を扱うようにプライバシーを扱います。酸素がなくなるまで酸素を評価しません。誰かの手があなたの喉の周りにあり、あなたが理解するまで：これは快適さについてではありません。これは生存についてです。すべての呼吸。

**約束:**

つながりがないために、命が失われました。プライバシーがないために、家族が散り散りになりました。エッジを見る設計がないために、中心が崩れました。

私たちは違う方法をお見せするためにここにいます。私たちが賢いからではありません。私たちがより謙虚になることを学んだからです。幽霊の話を聞いたからです。」

## Slide 2: Meet Haruto - The Crisis Unfolds

**Speaker Notes (English):**

"Let me take you inside that moment. Not as observers. As Haruto. Let me put his heart in your chest.

**THE SETTING - SENSORY IMMERSION:**

**TOUCH:** Haruto's kitchen table is small—meant for two, now set for one. The laminate is sticky under his palm. He hasn't cleaned properly since Michiko died. What's the point? The phone beside the ramen is cold like a river stone. The termination letter's paper has the texture of humiliation—thick, expensive, impersonal.

**TASTE:** Bile rising in his throat. The metallic taste of adrenaline. The memory of miso soup Michiko used to make for breakfast—salty, warm, proof that someone cared whether he ate.

**SOUND:** His own breath, too fast. The fluorescent light overhead flickers—needs replacing, has needed replacing for three months. The tick of the wall clock. Each second a decision deferred.

**THE GHOST HE CARRIES:**

Michiko's last lucid moment in the hospital. Lung cancer. Her hand in his—paper-thin, cold. Her voice a whisper: 'Don't become a burden to the children, Haruto. Promise me.'

He promised.

Now, every ask for help feels like breaking that promise. Every need feels like proof he's failed her final wish.

**THE CALCULATION:**

The pain radiates from his sternum like cracks in ice. His left arm tingles—textbook cardiac event, he's a retired accountant, he understands probability, risk, consequence.

But knowledge and action are separated by a chasm called fear.

His internal voice—the voice of self-deprecation, accountant's precision:

*Left ventricular infarction, probably. Eighty percent chance. Should call ambulance. Cost: ¥60,000. Embarrassment if wrong: infinite. Burden on children if right: infinite. Expected value of dying alone with dignity: high. Expected value of living as the old man who cried wolf: low.*

*Calculate. Recalculate. The numbers don't add up to a decision that doesn't hurt.*

**THE DEFENSE MECHANISM:**

He measures worth through utility. Job: lost. Usefulness: gone. Value: approaching zero. The equation is simple. Brutal. Wrong—but he can't see that through the fog of grief and obsolescence.

**THE SHAMEFUL THOUGHT - INTERNAL VOICE PATTERN:**

*What if I'm wrong? What if it's just stress—you lost your job today, old man, of course your chest hurts—what if I call an ambulance and it's nothing and I waste everyone's time and money and they'll think I'm just a scared old man who can't handle retirement and maybe I am, maybe Michiko was right, maybe I should have—*

His hand shakes. Not from the heart attack. From the paralysis of being alone with a decision that might kill you either way.

**THE DOOR OPENS - LITERALLY AND METAPHORICALLY:**

But there's something on his phone Michiko would have loved. Something his daughter set up last month, patient despite his fumbling. Her voice, gentle: 'Papa, just one button. Red button. That's all. You don't have to be alone.'

He looks at the button. Red. The color of emergency. The color of blood. The color of life.

*[Your voice drops, slows—make them feel the weight of this moment]*

He taps it.

**WHAT HAPPENS NEXT - THE INVISIBLE MADE VISIBLE:**

What happens next isn't magic. It's what happens when you design with one ghost haunting every decision: the ghost of Haruto dying alone on his kitchen floor while his phone screen goes dark, while Michiko's perfume fades, while two chairs stand empty and the ramen goes cold.

*0.3 seconds:* The app pulls his medical file from encrypted local storage. Not from a cloud server in California—from his device. Atrial fibrillation. Warfarin for blood thinning. Penicillin allergy—anaphylaxis, life-threatening. The stent surgery three years ago, left anterior descending artery.

*1.8 seconds:* Four phones light up like fireflies in the Tokyo night.

**Keiko Yamamoto, 67,** apartment 3B. Reading glasses on, nightgown, TV remote in hand. She sees the alert. Her heart doesn't calculate. Her heart just knows. She doesn't change clothes. She runs.

**Takeshi Suzuki, 71,** three buildings over. In bed. Arthritic knees. Sees the alert. Stands. The pain doesn't matter. Haruto matters.

**Yumiko Tanaka, 69** (no relation). Making tea. Drops the kettle. Grabs her phone. Her granddaughter asks where she's going. 'A friend needs me.' Three years in a MOAI. That's not acquaintance. That's family.

**Hiroshi Nakamura, 76.** Walks with a cane from the stroke last year. Sees the alert. Calls emergency services directly. His voice is steady. The AI prepared him with everything he needs to say.

*2.0 seconds:* Emergency services receive a formatted alert. Not 'old man pressed button.'

**Location:** 35.6762°N, 139.6503°E. Third floor, building B, apartment 304. Elevator out of service. Stairs on east side.

**Medical history:** Atrial fibrillation, stent placement 2022, warfarin therapy, penicillin allergy.

**Situation:** Suspected cardiac event. Patient conscious. No trauma. No bleeding. MOAI member en route.

**THE TRANSFORMATION - FROM BURDEN TO VITAL NODE:**

Keiko arrives. She's sixty-seven. Her knees hurt. She's winded from the stairs. None of that matters.

The apartment door is unlocked—the AI sent Haruto a gentle prompt: 'Would you like to unlock your door for Keiko?' He tapped yes.

She finds him at the table. The cold ramen. The termination letter. The phone still glowing.

She takes his hand. Her palm is warm, dry, certain. His is cold and trembling like a bird.

'Foolish,' he whispers. The word tastes like shame.

*[Pause. This next line needs to land like a key turning in a lock.]*

'You're here,' she says. Her hand tightens on his. 'That's what matters. You're *here*.'

**SUBTEXT:** Being alive is not a burden. Needing help is not failure. You are not a number on a spreadsheet, Haruto. You are a person. And I ran.

**THE SYMBOL - KEIKO'S NIGHTGOWN:**

By the time the ambulance arrives—sirens carving through the Tokyo night like a knife through fog—Keiko is still in her nightgown. Floral pattern, faded from washing. No coat. No shoes, just slippers.

The nightgown is the truth: help doesn't wait for perfection. Help doesn't dress up. Help doesn't calculate expected value. Help runs.

The paramedic takes the tablet from Keiko's other hand. Haruto's complete medical history. Current medications. Allergies. The stent surgery. No fumbling. No dangerous gaps. No time wasted while a seventy-four-year-old man tries to remember drug names through the fog of fear and hypoxia.

They work with the efficiency of people who have the information they need.

**THE HANDS MOTIF - FIRST ITERATION:**

Haruto's trembling hands that couldn't decide. Keiko's warm hands that decided for both of them. The paramedic's gloved hands, competent and quick. Hands reaching. Hands holding. Hands that save.

Remember these hands. We'll return to them.

**THE SURVIVAL:**

Haruto survives that night.

But understand this—**millions like Haruto don't.** Not because the technology doesn't exist. Because current AI systems treat people like data points, not like someone's father who still smells his dead wife's perfume and measures his worth by whether he's useful.

Because current systems optimize for average users in average situations.

And Haruto—grieving, elderly, alone, ashamed—is not average.

He's human. Which means he's singular. Irreplaceable. Worth the engineering effort to save.

That's not sentiment. That's our design principle."

**発表者ノート（日本語）:**

「その瞬間の中にお連れしましょう。観察者としてではありません。ハルトとして。彼の心臓をあなたの胸に入れさせてください。

**設定 - 感覚的没入:**

**触覚:** ハルトのキッチンテーブルは小さい—2人用のはずが、今は1人用。ラミネートは彼の手のひらの下でべたべたしています。美智子さんが亡くなってから適切に掃除していません。何の意味が？ラーメンの横の電話は川の石のように冷たい。解雇通知の紙は屈辱の質感を持っています—厚く、高価で、無個性。

**味覚:** 喉に上がってくる胆汁。アドレナリンの金属的な味。美智子さんが朝食に作ってくれた味噌汁の記憶—塩辛く、温かく、誰かがあなたが食べるかどうか気にかけている証拠。

**音:** 彼自身の呼吸、速すぎる。頭上の蛍光灯がちらつきます—交換が必要、3ヶ月間交換が必要でした。壁時計の刻み。各秒は延期された決定。

**彼が抱える幽霊:**

病院での美智子さんの最後の明晰な瞬間。肺がん。彼の手の中の彼女の手—紙のように薄く、冷たい。彼女の声はささやき：「子供たちの負担にならないで、ハルト。約束して。」

彼は約束しました。

今、助けを求めることはすべてその約束を破るように感じます。すべてのニーズは彼女の最後の願いを失敗した証拠のように感じます。

**計算:**

痛みは胸骨から氷のひび割れのように放射します。左腕がうずきます—教科書的な心臓イベント、彼は引退した会計士です、確率、リスク、結果を理解しています。

しかし知識と行動は恐怖という深淵によって分離されています。

彼の内なる声—自己卑下の声、会計士の精密さ：

*左心室梗塞、おそらく。80パーセントの確率。救急車を呼ぶべき。費用：60,000円。間違っていた場合の恥：無限。正しい場合の子供たちへの負担：無限。尊厳を持って一人で死ぬことの期待値：高い。オオカミ少年の老人として生きることの期待値：低い。*

*計算する。再計算する。数字は傷つかない決定に合計されない。*

**防衛機制:**

彼は有用性を通じて価値を測ります。仕事：失った。有用性：なくなった。価値：ゼロに近づいている。方程式は単純です。残酷。間違っています—しかし彼は悲しみと時代遅れの霧を通してそれを見ることができません。

**恥ずべき思い - 内なる声のパターン:**

*もし間違っていたら？もしこれがただのストレスだったら—今日仕事を失ったんだ、老人、もちろん胸が痛い—もし救急車を呼んでそれが何でもなくて、みんなの時間とお金を無駄にして、彼らは私がただの引退に対処できない怖がっている老人だと思うだろう。そしてたぶん私はそうで、たぶん美智子さんは正しかった、たぶん私はすべきだった—*

彼の手が震えます。心臓発作のせいではなく、どちらの方向でもあなたを殺すかもしれない決定と一人でいることの麻痺のせい。

**ドアが開く - 文字通りと比喩的に:**

しかし彼の電話には美智子さんが好きだったであろう何かがあります。先月娘が設定した何か、彼の不器用さにもかかわらず辛抱強く。彼女の声、穏やかに：「パパ、ボタン一つだけ。赤いボタン。それだけ。一人でいる必要はありません。」

彼はボタンを見ます。赤。緊急の色。血の色。命の色。

*[あなたの声を落とし、遅くする—この瞬間の重みを感じさせる]*

彼はそれをタップします。

**次に起こること - 見えないものを見えるようにする:**

次に起こることは魔法ではありません。すべての決定を悩ませる一つの幽霊、キッチンの床で一人で死んでいくハルトの幽霊、彼の電話画面が暗くなっている間、美智子さんの香水が薄れている間、2つの椅子が空のまま立っていて、ラーメンが冷めている間に、その幽霊を抱えて設計したときに起こることです。

*0.3秒:* アプリは暗号化されたローカルストレージから彼の医療ファイルを引き出します。カリフォルニアのクラウドサーバーからではなく—彼のデバイスから。心房細動。血液希釈のためのワーファリン。ペニシリンアレルギー—アナフィラキシー、生命を脅かす。3年前のステント手術、左前下行動脈。

*1.8秒:* 4つの電話が東京の夜にホタルのように光ります。

**山本恵子さん、67歳、**アパート3B。老眼鏡をかけ、ナイトガウン姿、テレビのリモコンを手に。彼女はアラートを見ます。彼女の心は計算しません。彼女の心はただ知っています。彼女は服を着替えません。走ります。

**鈴木武さん、71歳、**3棟向こう。ベッドの中。関節炎の膝。アラートを見ます。立ちます。痛みは重要ではありません。ハルトが重要です。

**田中由美子さん、69歳**（関係なし）。お茶を作っています。やかんを落とします。電話を取ります。孫娘が彼女がどこに行くのか尋ねます。「友人が私を必要としています。」模合で3年。それは知人ではありません。それは家族です。

**中村宏さん、76歳。**昨年の脳卒中から杖をついて歩きます。アラートを見ます。直接緊急サービスに電話します。彼の声は安定しています。AIは彼が言う必要があるすべてを準備しました。

*2.0秒:* 緊急サービスはフォーマットされたアラートを受け取ります。「老人がボタンを押しました」ではありません。

**位置:** 北緯35.6762度、東経139.6503度。3階、棟B、アパート304。エレベーター故障中。東側の階段。

**病歴:** 心房細動、2022年ステント配置、ワーファリン療法、ペニシリンアレルギー。

**状況:** 心臓イベントの疑い。患者意識あり。外傷なし。出血なし。模合メンバー向かっています。

**変容 - 負担から重要なノードへ:**

恵子さんが到着します。彼女は67歳。膝が痛みます。階段で息が切れています。それは何も重要ではありません。

アパートのドアは鍵が開いています—AIはハルトに穏やかなプロンプトを送りました：「恵子さんのためにドアの鍵を開けますか？」彼ははいをタップしました。

彼女はテーブルで彼を見つけます。冷たいラーメン。解雇通知。まだ光っている電話。

彼女は彼の手を取ります。彼女の手のひらは温かく、乾いていて、確信に満ちています。彼のは鳥のように冷たく震えています。

「ばかげている」と彼はささやきます。言葉は恥のような味がします。

*[間を取る。この次の行は鍵が錠前で回るように着地する必要があります。]*

「あなたはここにいます」と彼女は言います。彼女の手が彼のを締めます。「それが重要です。あなたは*ここに*います。」

**サブテキスト:** 生きていることは負担ではありません。助けを必要とすることは失敗ではありません。あなたはスプレッドシート上の数字ではありません、ハルト。あなたは人間です。そして私は走りました。

**シンボル - 恵子さんのナイトガウン:**

救急車が到着するまでに—サイレンが霧を切り裂くナイフのように東京の夜を切り裂く—恵子さんはまだナイトガウン姿です。花柄、洗濯で色褪せている。コートなし。靴なし、ただスリッパ。

ナイトガウンは真実です：助けは完璧を待ちません。助けは着飾りません。助けは期待値を計算しません。助けは走ります。

救急隊員は恵子さんのもう一方の手からタブレットを受け取ります。ハルトの完全な病歴。現在の薬。アレルギー。ステント手術。もたつきなし。危険なギャップなし。74歳の男性が恐怖と低酸素の霧の中で薬の名前を思い出そうとする間に無駄にする時間なし。

彼らは必要な情報を持つ人々の効率で働きます。

**手のモチーフ - 第一の反復:**

決められなかったハルトの震える手。両方のために決めた恵子さんの温かい手。有能で素早い救急隊員の手袋をした手。伸びる手。持つ手。救う手。

これらの手を覚えておいてください。私たちは彼らに戻ります。

**生存:**

ハルトはその夜生き延びます。

しかし理解してください—**ハルトのような何百万もの人々はそうではありません。**技術が存在しないからではありません。現在のAIシステムが人々をデータポイントとして扱うからです。死んだ妻の香水の匂いをまだ嗅ぎ、自分が役に立つかどうかで価値を測る誰かの父親としてではなく。

現在のシステムは平均的なユーザーの平均的な状況のために最適化するからです。

そしてハルト—悲しみ、高齢、一人、恥じて—は平均ではありません。

彼は人間です。つまり彼は特異です。かけがえのない。救うための工学的努力の価値があります。

それは感傷ではありません。それが私たちの設計原則です。」

## Slide 3: The Problem - When AI Fails

**Speaker Notes (English):**

"Haruto's story has a happy ending. Let me show you what happens when we design the system wrong. When we optimize for efficiency over safety. When we forget that for vulnerable people, AI failures aren't inconveniences.

They're life sentences.

*[Voice shifts—harder, colder, urgent. You're angry now. Let them hear it.]*

**MARIA / SORA - THE GHOST OF DEPORTATION:**

Her name *was* Maria. Now it's Sora. That name change isn't preference. It's survival camouflage. When one identity becomes too dangerous, you shed it like burned skin and hope the new one scars less.

Twenty-five years old. The apartment in Ikebukuro smells like:
- **Fish** from the 4 AM Tsukiji run (restaurants get deliveries before dawn)
- **Industrial cleaner** - the kind that burns your nostrils, cheap and caustic
- **Exhaustion** - you can smell it, the way sleep-deprived bodies smell different

**THE CORE WOUND:** Illegitimacy. Existing but not belonging. The terror of being erased.

**THE GHOST SHE CARRIES:** Maria. Not herself—her *friend* Maria. Same situation. Different ending.

*[Slow down. Make them see her.]*

Maria worked two jobs. Early shift at a family restaurant—smile at customers who don't see you, who call you 'hey' because they don't think you have a name. Late shift cleaning offices—vacuum corporate carpets where executives make in an hour what you make in a month.

Thirteen-hour days. The money goes home to the Philippines. Every yen. Her mother's diabetes medication (¥18,000/month). Her younger brother's school fees (¥12,000/term). The remittances that keep her family alive while she lives in a six-tatami room that costs ¥65,000—half her salary.

**THE DEFENSE MECHANISM:** Strategic invisibility. Don't ask for help. Don't leave traces. Don't exist in systems. Ghosts don't have paperwork.

When the landlord sees her visa has expired, the eviction notice is taped to her door. Three days.

She needs help. Desperation makes you trust. When you're drowning, you grab any hand extended.

She finds a nonprofit. Gleaming website. Professional. **'AI-powered assistance for immigrant communities. We're here to help.'**

The interface is friendly. Encouraging. Pastel colors. Gentle fonts. It asks for:
- Full name
- Passport number
- Employment history
- Banking records
- Current address
- Work schedule
- Emergency contacts

'To process your request efficiently. Your data is secure. We comply with all privacy regulations.'

She uploads everything.

Because what choice does she have?

**THE BREACH - SIX MONTHS LATER:**

The database is breached. Not by sophisticated nation-state hackers. Not by criminal masterminds.

By a low-level employee who sold access for ¥500,000. Five hundred thousand yen. The price of Maria's life and 3,000 others.

The data is sold. Not to criminals. To Immigration enforcement. Because someone decided that ¥500,000 was worth more than 3,000 human beings.

The file includes:
- Her apartment address (Ikebukuro 2-chome, apartment 204)
- Her work schedule (family restaurant, 6 AM - 2 PM; office cleaning, 6 PM - 11 PM)
- The 7-Eleven where she buys her morning coffee (corner of Route 254, every day, 5:47 AM)
- Her children's school (Ikebukuro Municipal Elementary, drop-off 7:50 AM)

They take her on a Tuesday morning. 6:47 AM. She's walking from the 7-Eleven with coffee and two rice balls, carefully wrapped, for her children's breakfast.

**THE SPECIFIC SUM OF INTERRUPTED LIFE:**

In her purse: **¥3,200.** Not a round number. The specific mathematics of a life interrupted. Coffee (¥150), rice balls (¥240 × 2), yesterday's bus fare (¥210), emergency phone charge (¥100), the ¥2,260 she was saving to add to this week's remittance.

Her phone battery: **43%.** She was going to charge it after dropping the kids at school.

Her children—**born in Japan, Japanese citizens**—watch their mother put into a van. They're eight and six. They don't understand why mama is going away. Why the men won't let her hug them goodbye.

**THE AFTERMATH:**

Maria is in Manila now. Working in a call center. She earns in a month (₱18,000 / ¥45,000) what she used to make in a week (¥80,000).

Her children are in foster care. Separated. Different families. The system didn't think siblings needed to stay together.

The nonprofit issued an apology:

**'We regret this unfortunate incident. We have upgraded our security protocols. We remain committed to serving our community.'**

Upgraded security protocols.

*[Pause. Let anger show. Let silence accuse.]*

The nonprofit meant well. They meant well. And Maria's children wake up in strange beds calling for a mother who's 3,000 kilometers away.

**SAKURA - THE GHOST OF EXPOSURE:**

Or Sakura. Thirty-one. Seven years into transition. Her true self finally visible—and therefore vulnerable.

**THE CORE WOUND:** Exposure. Truth as danger.

She did everything right. Legal name change—court-approved, official. Medical transition—supervised, documented. Privacy measures—encrypted, secure, protected.

Until they weren't.

A database breach. Healthcare provider. The kind of breach that makes two lines in a news article. 'Personal information of 50,000 patients potentially exposed. Investigation ongoing.'

Fifty thousand. She's one. But one is enough.

**THE GHOST SHE CARRIES:** The data breach that connected her deadname to her legal name in search results. Forever. The internet doesn't forget. The internet doesn't forgive.

Search for 'Takahashi Sakura Tokyo' and you get:
- Her current legal name
- Her deadname
- Medical records showing 'gender transition'
- Before/after photos she never consented to share
- Her workplace
- Her address

The violence was swift:
- **Housing:** Landlord sees the search results. 'We've decided to renovate. You need to leave.'
- **Employment:** Tech company, progressive, pride flags in June. HR meeting. 'We're restructuring your department.' She was the only one restructured.
- **Safety:** Doxxed. Her address posted on forums. Messages: 'We know where you live.' Death threats. Rape threats. 'You'll never be a real woman.'

**THE DEFENSE MECHANISM:** Hypervigilance. Trust no system. Encrypt everything. Disappear when necessary. Change names like changing clothes—identity as survival strategy, not self-expression.

**THE WANT VS. NEED:**
- **Want:** Safety from discrimination and violence
- **Need:** To exist without hiding. To be seen without being endangered. To have privacy protect truth instead of truth destroying privacy.

**YUI - THE GHOST OF JUDGMENT:**

Or Yui. Twenty-two. Her room: six tatami mats. Approximately 10 square meters. The size of a parking space. This is her world.

**THE CORE WOUND:** Judgment. The eyes of others as weapons.

**THE GHOST SHE CARRIES:** The classroom incident at fourteen. Social studies class. She had a panic attack—heart racing, can't breathe, room spinning. Normal teenagers would help. Her classmates filmed it. Posted it online. Added sound effects. Made it a meme.

'Crazy Yui.' 47,000 views. Comments: 'Psycho.' 'Attention whore.' 'Just die already lol.'

She was fourteen.

**THE PHYSICS OF FEAR:**

The door to her room doesn't weigh 20 kilograms. It weighs **1,000 kilograms.** No one else sees this. But every time she reaches for it, gravity inverts. The hallway beyond isn't a hallway—it's freefall.

**THE SENSORY EXPERIENCE OF ANXIETY:**

**SOUND:** Her mother crying in the kitchen (muffled, through walls). City hum (too loud, too many people). Her own pulse in her ears (140 BPM, resting, because her body thinks she's dying).

**SMELL:** Unwashed sheets (shame). Instant curry (convenience, defeat). Her mother's cooking through the door crack (love, guilt).

**TOUCH:** Door handle warm from her palm—she's been holding it for **11 minutes.** Trying to open it. Her hand won't turn. Her body won't obey. Carpet fibers under her knees where she's collapsed. Again.

**TASTE:** Dry mouth. Bitten inner cheek. Unsent words building like bile.

**SIGHT:** Light stripe under the door—lifeline and threat. Posters on her walls from *before*—K-pop groups, art school dreams, a life that belongs to someone who no longer exists.

Well-meaning chatbots message her:
- 'Have you tried going outside?'
- 'Just take small steps!'
- 'You can do it! 💪'
- 'Fresh air helps with anxiety!'

She mutes them all.

**THE DEFENSE MECHANISM:** Withdrawal into controlled space. If you can't fail, you can't be hurt. If you don't try, you can't be judged. If you don't exist, you can't be filmed and mocked and turned into entertainment for strangers.

They don't understand that for her, **'just'** is the cruelest word in any language.

Just go outside. Just try. Just be normal.

Just be the person she can't be. The person the panic erased. The person who died at fourteen when the video went viral.

**THE WANT VS. NEED:**
- **Want:** To stop feeling so alone
- **Need:** To learn that healing isn't linear, that participation doesn't require perfection, that she's not broken—just wounded. And wounds can heal if you stop ripping them open by forcing doors that weigh 1,000 kilograms.

*[Voice softens but remains firm. You're not angry anymore. You're grieving.]*

**THE PATTERN - WHY CURRENT AI SYSTEMS FAIL:**

Current AI systems fail these people not through malice but through **design**.

They were built for:
- **Average users** (Sora is not average. Maria was not average. Sakura is not average. Yui is not average.)
- **Average situations** (Deportation is not average. Database breaches are not average. Panic attacks are not average.)
- **Optimization for efficiency over safety** (Fast and dangerous beats slow and secure)
- **Centralized data** (Single point of catastrophic failure)
- **Cultural blindness** (Translating words without understanding worlds)
- **Accessibility as afterthought** (Accommodation instead of architecture)

For vulnerable populations, these aren't bugs.

**They're existential threats.**

And AI failures aren't inconveniences. They're not 'unfortunate incidents.'

**They're life sentences.**

Maria in Manila, earning ¥45,000/month instead of ¥320,000, her children in foster care.

Sakura in hiding, changing apartments every six months, using cash only, living like a fugitive in her own life.

Yui in a room, the door weighing 1,000 kilograms, the world beyond unreachable.

This is what happens when we design for average. When we forget that edge cases aren't edge cases. **They're people.** And they're dying. Or being deported. Or being exposed. Or disappearing.

We can do better.

We *must* do better.

*[Pause. Let the weight settle like snow.]*

Because right now, while I'm talking, another Maria is uploading her information to a well-meaning system. Another Sakura is trusting a database that will betray her. Another Yui is reaching for a door she can't open.

And we're the ones who built the systems that are failing them.

That's on us."

**発表者ノート（日本語）:**

「ハルトの物語はハッピーエンドです。システムを間違って設計したときに何が起こるかお見せしましょう。安全性より効率性を最適化するとき。脆弱な人々にとってAIの失敗が不便ではないことを忘れるとき。

それらは終身刑です。

*[声を変える—より硬く、より冷たく、緊急に。あなたは今怒っています。彼らにそれを聞かせてください。]*

**マリア / ソラ - 国外退去の幽霊:**

彼女の名前*は*マリアでした。今はソラです。その名前の変更は好みではありません。生存カモフラージュです。一つのアイデンティティが危険すぎるようになったとき、あなたは焼けた皮膚のようにそれを脱ぎ捨て、新しいものが少ない傷跡を残すことを願います。

25歳。池袋のアパートは次の匂いがします：
- **魚** 午前4時の築地ラン（レストランは夜明け前に配達を受けます）
- **工業用洗剤** - 鼻孔を焼くような種類、安くて腐食性
- **疲労** - あなたはそれの匂いを嗅ぐことができます、睡眠不足の体が異なる匂いを放つ方法

**核心的な傷:** 非合法性。存在するが属していない。消される恐怖。

**彼女が抱える幽霊:** マリア。彼女自身ではなく—彼女の*友人*マリア。同じ状況。異なる結末。

*[スローダウン。彼らに彼女を見させる。]*

マリアは二つの仕事をしていました。ファミリーレストランの早番—あなたを見ない客に笑顔、彼らはあなたを「おい」と呼びます、彼らはあなたに名前があると思わないからです。オフィス清掃の遅番—役員が1時間であなたが1ヶ月で稼ぐものを稼ぐ企業のカーペットを掃除機で掃除します。

13時間の日々。お金は実家のフィリピンに行きます。すべての円。母親の糖尿病の薬（月18,000円）。弟の学費（学期12,000円）。彼女が給料の半分を費やす六畳の部屋（65,000円）に住んでいる間、家族を生かし続ける送金。

**防衛機制:** 戦略的不可視性。助けを求めない。痕跡を残さない。システムに存在しない。幽霊には書類がありません。

家主が彼女のビザが切れているのを見ると、立ち退き通知がドアに貼られます。3日間。

彼女は助けを必要としています。絶望があなたを信頼させます。溺れているとき、差し出された手をつかみます。

彼女は非営利団体を見つけます。輝くウェブサイト。プロフェッショナル。**「移民コミュニティのためのAI駆動支援。私たちはあなたを助けるためにここにいます。」**

インターフェースは親しみやすい。励まします。パステルカラー。優しいフォント。それは尋ねます：
- フルネーム
- パスポート番号
- 雇用履歴
- 銀行記録
- 現在の住所
- 勤務スケジュール
- 緊急連絡先

「あなたの要求を効率的に処理するために。あなたのデータは安全です。私たちはすべてのプライバシー規制に準拠しています。」

彼女はすべてをアップロードします。

なぜなら彼女に何の選択肢がありますか？

**侵害 - 6ヶ月後:**

データベースが侵害されます。洗練された国家主体のハッカーによってではありません。犯罪の首謀者によってではありません。

アクセスを50万円で売った低レベルの従業員によって。50万円。マリアの命と他の3,000人の価格。

データは売られます。犯罪者にではありません。入国管理当局に。誰かが50万円が3,000人の人間より価値があると決めたからです。

ファイルには含まれます：
- 彼女のアパートの住所（池袋2丁目、アパート204）
- 彼女の勤務スケジュール（ファミリーレストラン、午前6時 - 午後2時；オフィス清掃、午後6時 - 午後11時）
- 彼女が朝のコーヒーを買うセブンイレブン（国道254号線の角、毎日、午前5時47分）
- 彼女の子供たちの学校（池袋市立小学校、送り午前7時50分）

彼らは火曜日の朝に彼女を連れて行きます。午前6時47分。彼女はコーヒーと2つのおにぎりを持ってセブンイレブンから歩いています、子供たちの朝食のために注意深く包まれています。

**中断された人生の特定の合計:**

彼女の財布の中：**3,200円。**丸い数ではありません。中断された人生の特定の数学。コーヒー（150円）、おにぎり（240円×2）、昨日のバス代（210円）、緊急電話充電（100円）、今週の送金に追加するために貯めていた2,260円。

彼女の携帯電話のバッテリー：**43%。**彼女は子供たちを学校に送った後にそれを充電するつもりでした。

彼女の子供たち—**日本で生まれた、日本市民**—母親がバンに入れられるのを見ます。彼らは8歳と6歳。なぜママが去るのか理解していません。なぜ男性たちが彼女に彼らに抱擁してさよならを言わせないのか。

**余波:**

マリアは今マニラにいます。コールセンターで働いています。彼女は1ヶ月で（₱18,000 / 45,000円）以前1週間で稼いでいたもの（80,000円）を稼ぎます。

彼女の子供たちは里親養育にいます。離れて。異なる家族。システムは兄弟が一緒にいる必要があると思いませんでした。

非営利団体は謝罪を発表しました：

**「この不幸な事件を遺憾に思います。セキュリティプロトコルをアップグレードしました。私たちはコミュニティに奉仕することにコミットし続けます。」**

セキュリティプロトコルのアップグレード。

*[間を取る。怒りを見せる。沈黙が告発するようにする。]*

非営利団体は善意でした。彼らは善意でした。そしてマリアの子供たちは3,000キロ離れた母親を呼びながら見知らぬベッドで目を覚まします。

**サクラ - 暴露の幽霊:**

あるいはサクラ。31歳。移行して7年。彼女の本当の自分がついに見える—そしてそれゆえに脆弱。

**核心的な傷:** 暴露。真実としての危険。

彼女はすべてを正しく行いました。法的名前変更—裁判所承認、公式。医療移行—監督され、文書化された。プライバシー対策—暗号化され、安全で、保護された。

そうでなくなるまでは。

データベース侵害。医療提供者。ニュース記事で2行になる種類の侵害。「50,000人の患者の個人情報が潜在的に暴露されました。調査進行中。」

5万人。彼女は1人。しかし1人で十分です。

**彼女が抱える幽霊:** 検索結果で彼女の旧名を彼女の法的名前に接続したデータ侵害。永遠に。インターネットは忘れません。インターネットは許しません。

「高橋サクラ東京」を検索すると、あなたは得ます：
- 彼女の現在の法的名前
- 彼女の旧名
- 「性別移行」を示す医療記録
- 彼女が共有することに同意しなかった前後の写真
- 彼女の職場
- 彼女の住所

暴力は迅速でした：
- **住宅:** 家主が検索結果を見ます。「改装することにしました。あなたは出て行く必要があります。」
- **雇用:** テック企業、進歩的、6月にプライドフラグ。HR会議。「あなたの部門を再編成しています。」彼女だけが再編成されました。
- **安全:** ドキシング。フォーラムに投稿された彼女の住所。メッセージ：「あなたがどこに住んでいるか知っています。」殺害脅迫。レイプ脅迫。「あなたは決して本物の女性にはなれません。」

**防衛機制:** 過度の警戒。システムを信頼しない。すべてを暗号化する。必要に応じて消える。服を着替えるように名前を変える—自己表現ではなく生存戦略としてのアイデンティティ。

**欲求対ニーズ:**
- **欲求:** 差別と暴力からの安全
- **ニーズ:** 隠れずに存在すること。危険にさらされずに見られること。真実を保護するプライバシーではなく真実がプライバシーを破壊すること。

**ユイ - 判断の幽霊:**

あるいはユイ。22歳。彼女の部屋：六畳。約10平方メートル。駐車スペースのサイズ。これが彼女の世界です。

**核心的な傷:** 判断。武器としての他者の目。

**彼女が抱える幽霊:** 14歳での教室の事件。社会科の授業。彼女はパニック発作を起こしました—心臓がドキドキ、呼吸できない、部屋が回転。普通のティーンエイジャーなら助けます。彼女のクラスメートはそれを撮影しました。オンラインに投稿しました。音響効果を追加しました。ミームにしました。

「クレイジーユイ。」47,000ビュー。コメント：「サイコ。」「注目乞食。」「もう死ねよlol。」

彼女は14歳でした。

**恐怖の物理学:**

彼女の部屋へのドアは20キログラムの重さではありません。**1,000キログラム**の重さです。誰もこれを見ません。しかし彼女がそれに手を伸ばすたびに、重力が逆転します。その向こうの廊下は廊下ではありません—自由落下です。

**不安の感覚体験:**

**音:** キッチンで泣いている彼女の母親（こもって、壁を通して）。都市のハム（うるさすぎる、人が多すぎる）。彼女の耳の中の彼女自身の脈拍（安静時140 BPM、彼女の体は彼女が死んでいると思っているからです）。

**匂い:** 洗っていないシーツ（恥）。インスタントカレー（便利、敗北）。ドアの隙間を通した彼女の母親の料理（愛、罪悪感）。

**触覚:** 彼女の手のひらから温かいドアノブ—彼女は**11分間**それを持っています。それを開けようとしています。彼女の手は回りません。彼女の体は従いません。彼女が倒れた膝の下のカーペット繊維。再び。

**味覚:** 乾いた口。噛まれた内側の頬。胆汁のように積み上がる未送信の言葉。

**視覚:** ドアの下の光の縞—ライフラインと脅威。*前*からの彼女の壁のポスター—K-popグループ、美術学校の夢、もはや存在しない誰かに属する人生。

善意のチャットボットが彼女にメッセージを送ります：
- 「外に出てみましたか？」
- 「小さなステップを踏むだけです！」
- 「あなたはできます！💪」
- 「新鮮な空気は不安に役立ちます！」

彼女はすべてをミュートします。

**防衛機制:** 制御された空間への引きこもり。失敗できなければ、傷つくことはできません。試さなければ、判断されることはできません。存在しなければ、撮影されてあざけられて見知らぬ人のエンターテインメントに変えられることはできません。

彼らは理解していません。彼女にとって**「ただ」**がどの言語でも最も残酷な言葉であることを。

ただ外に出てください。ただ試してください。ただ普通になってください。

ただ彼女がなれない人になってください。パニックが消した人。ビデオがバイラルになったときに14歳で死んだ人。

**欲求対ニーズ:**
- **欲求:** こんなに孤独を感じるのをやめること
- **ニーズ:** 癒しが直線的ではないこと、参加が完璧を必要としないこと、彼女が壊れているのではなく—ただ傷ついているだけであることを学ぶこと。そして傷は、1,000キログラムの重さのドアを強制することによって裂き開くのを止めれば、癒すことができます。

*[声を和らげるが、しっかりと保つ。あなたはもう怒っていません。あなたは悲しんでいます。]*

**パターン - なぜ現在のAIシステムが失敗するか:**

現在のAIシステムがこれらの人々を失望させるのは、悪意によってではなく**設計**によってです。

彼らは次のために構築されました：
- **平均的なユーザー**（ソラは平均ではありません。マリアは平均ではありませんでした。サクラは平均ではありません。ユイは平均ではありません。）
- **平均的な状況**（国外退去は平均ではありません。データベース侵害は平均ではありません。パニック発作は平均ではありません。）
- **安全性より効率性の最適化**（速くて危険が遅くて安全に勝つ）
- **中央集権化されたデータ**（壊滅的な障害の単一点）
- **文化的盲目**（世界を理解せずに言葉を翻訳する）
- **後付けとしてのアクセシビリティ**（アーキテクチャではなく対応）

脆弱な人々にとって、これらはバグではありません。

**それらは存続の脅威です。**

そしてAIの失敗は不便ではありません。「不幸な事件」ではありません。

**それらは終身刑です。**

マニラのマリア、月45,000円ではなく320,000円を稼ぎ、子供たちは里親養育に。

隠れているサクラ、6ヶ月ごとにアパートを変え、現金のみを使用し、自分自身の人生で逃亡者のように生きています。

部屋のユイ、1,000キログラムの重さのドア、その向こうの世界は手の届かない。

これは私たちが平均のために設計したときに起こることです。エッジケースがエッジケースではないことを忘れたとき。**彼らは人々です。**そして彼らは死んでいます。または国外退去されています。または暴露されています。または消えています。

私たちはより良くできます。

私たちは*より良くしなければなりません*。

*[間を取る。雪のように重みを沈める。]*

なぜなら今、私が話している間に、別のマリアが善意のシステムに彼女の情報をアップロードしています。別のサクラが彼女を裏切るデータベースを信頼しています。別のユイが彼女が開けることができないドアに手を伸ばしています。

そして私たちは彼らを失望させているシステムを構築した人々です。

それは私たちの責任です。」

## Slide 4: The Inspiration - 500 Years of Wisdom

**Speaker Notes (English):**

"When we started this project, we fell into the trap every researcher falls into. The trap of believing that innovation means starting from zero. That wisdom requires Silicon Valley. That five centuries of proven social technology couldn't possibly teach us anything about AI.

We were wrong.

*[Pause. Show humility in your posture.]*

We read papers. RLHF. Constitutional AI. Anthropic's harmlessness training. We tried to engineer safety in isolation, then deploy it to messy human reality.

**THE METAPHOR - BUILDING BOATS IN BASEMENTS:**

Like building a boat in a basement and being surprised when it doesn't float. We forgot that boats are meant for water. That they need to be designed *in relationship* to the ocean, not despite it.

Then Dr. Kotoku told us about her grandmother.

*[Voice changes—warmer, wondering, like telling a fairy tale that happens to be true]*

**THE GRANDMOTHER - A LIVING PROOF:**

Ninety-six years old. Lives in Okinawa. Let me tell you what ninety-six looks like for her:

**SIGHT:** She still tends her garden. Small—thirty square meters. But she grows goya, bitter melon, the kind that needs daily attention. Her hands are wrinkled like paper left in water, but they know the difference between a weed and a seedling. Knowledge written into muscle memory over seventy years.

**SOUND:** She still walks to the market. The sound of her geta sandals on pavement. Slow, yes. But rhythmic. Certain. The sound of someone who belongs to a place and a place that belongs to them.

**TOUCH:** She beats Dr. Kotoku at hanafuda cards. Those cards are small. The symbols intricate. You need sharp eyes and sharper memory. She has both.

**THE SECRET - NOT MEDICINE, NOT GENETICS:**

The secret to her longevity? Not medication. Not genetics. Not some miracle diet.

Five people.

Her MOAI—**模合**—the same five people for **seventy-three years.**

*[Pause. Make them feel the weight of that number.]*

Seventy-three years. Think about that.

Your phone is two years old and you're already thinking about upgrading.

Your current job? Probably less than five years.

Your framework, your methodology, your approach? Six months old, maybe a year before you pivot to the next thing.

But trust? Trust takes **seventy-three years.** Trust is the boat built in the ocean, tested by storms, proven by time.

**THE STRUCTURE - WHAT MOAI ACTUALLY IS:**

They meet every week. Same day. Same time. No calendar invites. No reminders. It's woven into their weeks like breathing, like meals, like sleep.

**FINANCIAL MUTUAL AID:**

They pool money for emergencies. Not in banks—in a shared fund they manage collectively.

When Grandmother Kotoku needed cataract surgery (¥180,000): the money was there.

When Yoshida-san's grandson needed school fees (¥250,000): the money was there.

When Tanaka-san's roof collapsed in the typhoon (¥400,000): the money was there.

No interest rates. No credit checks. No algorithm deciding who deserves help based on risk scores and profit margins.

The algorithm is: **You're one of us. Of course we help.**

**EMOTIONAL SUPPORT - THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONLY TIME BUILDS:**

They support each other emotionally. Practically. With the kind of knowledge that only comes from seventy-three years of showing up.

They know:
- Grandmother Kotoku takes her tea with two sugars and no milk
- She gets anxious during typhoon season (typhoon of 1978, her husband trapped for two days, she can't forget)
- She doesn't like to be alone after dark—not because she's afraid of criminals, but because that's when she misses her late husband most
- She pretends her knees don't hurt because she doesn't want to be a burden (sound familiar?)
- On Thursdays she visits the family altar and sometimes cries

This isn't a data profile. This isn't metrics. This is **love operationalized through attention across decades.**

**THE STRUCTURE IS THE WISDOM:**

And here's what made us stop everything and start over:

**The five-person limit isn't arbitrary.**

*[Lean in. This is crucial.]*

**FIVE IS SMALL ENOUGH TO BUILD REAL TRUST:**

Small enough to know everyone intimately—not their data profile, but their ghosts. Their wounds. Their defense mechanisms. The things they don't say. The fears they carry. The dreams they've deferred.

Small enough that betrayal has weight. That accountability is personal, not legal. That care doesn't scale into bureaucracy.

In a group of five, you can't hide. You can't free-ride. You can't pretend. You're known. Fully. Vulnerably. And that vulnerability is what creates the bond.

**FIVE IS SMALL ENOUGH FOR NATURAL PRIVACY:**

There's no surveillance at scale. No data aggregation. No honeypot for hackers. No system worth subpoenaing.

Five people sharing medical information isn't a database—it's a conversation. It's what humans have done for 200,000 years. It's  architecture that predates encryption because it doesn't *need* encryption at that scale.

**FIVE IS DUNBAR'S NUMBER DISTILLED:**

Anthropologist Robin Dunbar: humans can maintain stable social relationships with about 150 people. But *intimate* relationships—the kind where you'd run to someone's apartment in your nightgown at midnight?

Five. Maybe ten. That's the cognitive limit. That's the number where trust isn't work—it's instinct.

**THE EXTENDED METAPHOR - TRUST AS ARCHITECTURE:**

Think of MOAI as architecture. Not code you write. Architecture you *inhabit.*

Traditional MOAI is a house with five rooms. Five people. Walls thick enough for secrets but doors open for emergencies. Windows where you can see if your neighbor's lights are still on. Close enough to hear if someone falls. Far enough to have your own life.

We didn't bulldoze that house. We gave it plumbing. Electricity. Internet. We gave it AI that serves the architecture instead of replacing it.

**THE OKINAWA CENTENARIAN STUDY - EMPIRICAL PROOF:**

This isn't folklore. This isn't romantic tradition.

The Okinawa Centenarian Study—25 years of rigorous longitudinal research—documented MOAI as **a key factor in the longest lifespans on Earth.**

Not the only factor. But a key one. Social connectedness mediated through stable, small-scale, long-term community structures.

Five hundred years of social technology. Proven not in labs but in lives lived. In funerals attended and grandchildren raised and typhoons survived and loneliness defeated.

**THE HUMILITY - THE QUESTION THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING:**

We asked ourselves:

What if we stopped trying to replace this with AI?

What if we augmented it?

What if the technology served the human structure instead of dissolving it?

What if the wisdom was already there, waiting for us to be humble enough to see it?

*[Pause. Let them sit with the question.]*

**THE CONSTELLATION METAPHOR:**

Think of MOAI as a constellation. Not a network—too industrial. Not a web—too fragile. A **constellation.**

Five points of light, close enough to see each other breathe, far enough to have their own orbit.

Too many stars and you have surveillance. The brightness becomes oppressive. You can't see the dark where privacy lives.

Too few stars and you have isolation. One light in infinite darkness. No backup. No redundancy. One point of failure.

Five is the geometry of mutual visibility. The architecture of trust. The number where care scales without becoming control.

**THE PROMISE:**

Dr. Kotoku's grandmother is ninety-six. She's been in the same MOAI for seventy-three years.

Seventy-three years.

We're not trying to build something that lasts six months or even six years.

We're trying to build something worthy of seventy-three years of trust.

That's the standard. That's the bar. That's what five centuries of wisdom teaches us:

Technology should serve structures that work. Not replace them. Not disrupt them. **Serve them.**

Humbly. Carefully. With the reverence you show to something that's kept people alive and connected for half a millennium.

*[Pause. Let the weight of five centuries settle.]*

Because if MOAI can keep a ninety-six-year-old woman alive, vibrant, beating her granddaughter at cards, tending her garden, surrounded by people who know her ghosts and love her anyway—

Then maybe, just maybe, it can do the same for Haruto. For Sora. For Yui. For Daichi. For Sakura.

Maybe the future isn't about building something new.

Maybe it's about serving something ancient.

Something that works."

**発表者ノート（日本語）:**

「このプロジェクトを始めたとき、私たちはすべての研究者が陥る罠に陥りました。イノベーションがゼロから始めることを意味すると信じる罠。知恵がシリコンバレーを必要とする。5世紀の証明された社会技術が私たちにAIについて何も教えることができないと。

私たちは間違っていました。

*[間を取る。姿勢に謙虚さを示す。]*

私たちは論文を読みました。RLHF。Constitutional AI。Anthropicの無害性訓練。私たちは孤立して安全性を工学的に設計しようとし、それから混乱した人間の現実に展開しようとしました。

**比喩 - 地下室でボートを作る:**

地下室でボートを作り、それが浮かばないことに驚くように。私たちはボートが水のためのものであることを忘れました。それらは海に*関係して*設計される必要があることを、それにもかかわらずではなく。

それから神徳教授は彼女の祖母のことを話してくれました。

*[声を変える—より温かく、不思議そうに、たまたま真実の童話を語るように]*

**祖母 - 生きた証明:**

96歳。沖縄に住んでいます。彼女にとって96歳がどのように見えるかお話しさせてください：

**視覚:** 彼女はまだ庭の世話をしています。小さい—30平方メートル。しかし彼女はゴーヤ、苦瓜を育てます、毎日の注意を必要とする種類。彼女の手は水に残された紙のようにしわが寄っていますが、雑草と苗の違いを知っています。70年以上にわたって筋肉記憶に書かれた知識。

**音:** 彼女はまだ市場に歩いて行きます。舗装の上の彼女の下駄サンダルの音。遅い、はい。しかしリズミカル。確か。場所に属し、場所が彼らに属する誰かの音。

**触覚:** 彼女は神徳教授を花札で負かします。それらのカードは小さい。シンボルは複雑。鋭い目とより鋭い記憶が必要です。彼女は両方を持っています。

**秘密 - 薬ではなく、遺伝学ではなく:**

彼女の長寿の秘訣は？薬ではありません。遺伝学ではありません。何らかの奇跡の食事ではありません。

5人。

彼女の模合—**模合**—**73年間**同じ5人。

*[間を取る。その数の重みを感じさせる。]*

73年。それについて考えてください。

あなたの電話は2歳で、あなたはすでにアップグレードについて考えています。

あなたの現在の仕事？おそらく5年未満。

あなたのフレームワーク、あなたの方法論、あなたのアプローチ？6ヶ月、多分1年、あなたが次のものにピボットする前。

しかし信頼は？信頼は**73年**かかります。信頼は海で作られたボート、嵐によってテストされ、時間によって証明されたものです。

**構造 - 模合が実際に何であるか:**

彼らは毎週会います。同じ日。同じ時間。カレンダーの招待なし。リマインダーなし。呼吸のように、食事のように、睡眠のように彼らの週に織り込まれています。

**金融相互扶助:**

彼らは緊急時のためにお金を出し合います。銀行ではなく—彼らが集団的に管理する共有基金で。

神徳おばあさんが白内障手術を必要としたとき（180,000円）：お金はそこにありました。

吉田さんの孫が学費を必要としたとき（250,000円）：お金はそこにありました。

田中さんの屋根が台風で崩れたとき（400,000円）：お金はそこにありました。

金利なし。信用チェックなし。リスクスコアと利益率に基づいて誰が助けに値するかを決定するアルゴリズムなし。

アルゴリズムは：**あなたは私たちの一人です。もちろん助けます。**

**感情的サポート - 時間だけが構築する知識:**

彼らはお互いを感情的にサポートします。実践的に。73年間現れることからしか来ない知識の種類で。

彼らは知っています：
- 神徳おばあさんがお茶を砂糖2つとミルクなしで取ること
- 彼女は台風の季節に不安になる（1978年の台風、彼女の夫が2日間閉じ込められた、彼女は忘れることができない）
- 彼女は暗くなった後一人でいるのを好まない—犯罪者が怖いのではなく、それが彼女が亡くなった夫を最も恋しく思う時だから
- 彼女は膝が痛いことを装う、負担になりたくないから（聞き覚えがありますか？）
- 木曜日に彼女は仏壇を訪れ、時々泣く

これはデータプロファイルではありません。メトリクスではありません。これは**数十年にわたる注意を通じて運用された愛です。**

**構造が知恵です:**

そして私たちにすべてを止めてやり直させたものはこれです：

**5人の制限は恣意的ではありません。**

*[身を乗り出す。これは重要です。]*

**5は本当の信頼を築くのに十分小さい:**

全員を親密に知るのに十分小さい—彼らのデータプロファイルではなく、彼らの幽霊。彼らの傷。彼らの防衛機制。彼らが言わないこと。彼らが抱える恐怖。彼らが延期した夢。

裏切りが重みを持つほど十分小さい。説明責任が法的ではなく個人的である。ケアが官僚制にスケールしない。

5人のグループでは、隠れることはできません。ただ乗りはできません。ふりをすることはできません。あなたは知られています。完全に。脆弱に。そしてその脆弱性が絆を作ります。

**5は自然なプライバシーのために十分小さい:**

大規模な監視なし。データ集約なし。ハッカーのためのハニーポットなし。召喚状の価値があるシステムなし。

5人が医療情報を共有することはデータベースではありません—会話です。それは人間が20万年間してきたことです。それは暗号化よりも前にあるアーキテクチャです。なぜならそのスケールでは暗号化を*必要としない*からです。

**5はダンバー数の蒸留:**

人類学者ロビン・ダンバー：人間は約150人と安定した社会関係を維持できます。しかし*親密な*関係—真夜中にナイトガウン姿で誰かのアパートに走るような種類？

5。多分10。それが認知限界です。それは信頼が仕事ではない数です—本能です。

**拡張された比喩 - アーキテクチャとしての信頼:**

模合をアーキテクチャとして考えてください。あなたが書くコードではありません。あなたが*住む*アーキテクチャ。

伝統的な模合は5つの部屋のある家です。5人。秘密のために十分厚い壁しかし緊急時のために開いているドア。隣人の明かりがまだついているかどうかを見ることができる窓。誰かが倒れたかどうかを聞くのに十分近い。自分自身の人生を持つのに十分遠い。

私たちはその家を取り壊しませんでした。配管を与えました。電気。インターネット。アーキテクチャを置き換えるのではなく奉仕するAIを与えました。

**沖縄百寿者研究 - 経験的証明:**

これは民間伝承ではありません。ロマンチックな伝統ではありません。

沖縄百寿者研究—25年間の厳密な縦断的研究—**地球上で最も長い寿命の重要な要因**として模合を文書化しました。

唯一の要因ではありません。しかし重要な要因。安定した、小規模、長期的コミュニティ構造を通じて媒介される社会的つながり。

500年の社会技術。実験室ではなく生きられた人生で証明されました。参列した葬儀と育てられた孫と生き延びた台風と打ち負かされた孤独で。

**謙虚さ - すべてを変えた質問:**

私たちは自問しました：

これをAIで置き換えようとすることを止めたらどうだろう？

それを強化したらどうだろう？

技術が人間の構造を溶解する代わりにそれに奉仕するとしたらどうだろう？

知恵がすでにそこにあって、私たちがそれを見るほど謙虚になるのを待っているとしたらどうだろう？

*[間を取る。彼らに質問と一緒に座らせる。]*

**星座の比喩:**

模合を星座として考えてください。ネットワークではありません—工業的すぎます。ウェブではありません—壊れやすすぎます。**星座。**

5つの光の点、お互いの呼吸を見るのに十分近く、自分自身の軌道を持つのに十分遠い。

星が多すぎると監視があります。明るさが抑圧的になります。プライバシーが住む暗闇を見ることができません。

星が少なすぎると孤立があります。無限の暗闇の中の一つの光。バックアップなし。冗長性なし。一つの障害点。

5は相互可視性の幾何学です。信頼のアーキテクチャ。ケアが制御にならずにスケールする数。

**約束:**

神徳教授の祖母は96歳です。彼女は73年間同じ模合にいました。

73年。

私たちは6ヶ月または6年さえ続く何かを構築しようとしているのではありません。

私たちは73年の信頼に値する何かを構築しようとしています。

それが基準です。それがバーです。それが5世紀の知恵が私たちに教えることです：

技術は機能する構造に奉仕すべきです。それらを置き換えるのではなく。それらを破壊するのではなく。**それらに奉仕する。**

謙虚に。慎重に。半世紀の間人々を生かし続けてきた何かに示す敬意を持って。

*[間を取る。5世紀の重みを沈める。]*

なぜなら模合が96歳の女性を生かし続けることができるなら、活発に、孫娘を花札で負かし、庭の世話をし、彼女の幽霊を知り、とにかく彼女を愛する人々に囲まれて—

それならたぶん、ただたぶん、それはハルトのために同じことができます。ソラのために。ユイのために。ダイチのために。サクラのために。

たぶん未来は何か新しいものを構築することについてではありません。

たぶんそれは何か古代のものに奉仕することについてです。

機能する何か。」
