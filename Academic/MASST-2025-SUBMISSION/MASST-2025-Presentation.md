## Slide 2: The Stakes - Why This Matters

**For Vulnerable Populations, AI Failures Aren't Inconveniences...**

**They're Catastrophes**

- ❌ Eviction from housing assistance errors
- ❌ Medical crises from misunderstood health data
- ❌ Deportation from privacy violations
- ❌ Violence from leaked domestic abuse records
- ❌ Discrimination from centralized data breaches

**Visual:** Split screen - on left, vulnerable individuals (elderly, disabled, refugees); on right, consequences of AI failures

**Key Message:** "Current multi-agent systems prioritize efficiency over safety"

---

## Slide 3: The Problem - Multi-Agent Safety Crisis

**Critical Challenges in Current Multi-Agent Systems**

**❌ Safety Risks**
- RLHF alone insufficient for vulnerable populations
- No context-aware behavioral guardrails
- Centralized architectures create single points of failure

**❌ Trust Calibration**
- Opacity in decision-making
- Unpredictable agent behavior
- Inadequate human oversight mechanisms

**❌ Privacy & Autonomy**
- Centralized data = existential risks
- Loss of community data sovereignty
- Erosion of human agency

**Visual:** Triangle diagram showing three interconnected risk areas

**Quote:** *"Multi-agent community support systems risk causing more harm than benefit"*

## Slide 4: What If We Started With Proven Human Systems?

**Meet MOAI (模合)**
**Okinawa's 500-Year-Old Social Innovation**

**Traditional MOAI Structure:**
- Exactly **5 people**
- **Lifelong** mutual aid collective
- **Financial, emotional, practical** support
- **Collective governance**

**The Evidence:**
- Okinawa Centenarian Study (1975-present)
- World's longest-running longevity research
- Highest concentration of centenarians globally
- Lower cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive decline

**Visual:** Photo of traditional Okinawan MOAI group + infographic showing longevity statistics

**Key Insight:** *"What if AI augmented—not replaced—these proven social structures?"*

---

## Slide 5: Research Question & Approach

**Research Question:**

*"How can multi-agent AI systems augment traditional mutual aid networks while preserving their essential human-centric properties, particularly when serving populations with diverse accessibility needs?"*

**Our Approach: Safety by Social Structure**

Rather than making AI "safe" through training alone...

**Embed AI within proven human social structures** that provide:
- ✅ Natural guardrails
- ✅ Built-in accountability
- ✅ Cultural context
- ✅ Human oversight
- ✅ Privacy by design (5-person limit)

**Visual:** Venn diagram showing intersection of Traditional MOAI + Multi-Agent AI + Accessibility = Digital MOAI

## Slide 6: Four Core Design Principles

**1. Human Primacy**
AI augments, never replaces, human relationships and decision-making

**2. Accessibility First**
Universal design from initial conception, not retrofitted accommodation

**3. Privacy Sovereignty**
Users maintain complete control over personal data

**4. Cultural Context-Awareness**
System respects diverse norms, values, and communication styles

**Visual:** Four pillars/columns supporting a structure labeled "Digital MOAI"

**Key Message:** *"These aren't features—they're foundational requirements"*

---

## Slide 7: Multi-Agent Architecture

**Traditional MOAI Structure (Preserved)**
- 5 human members who meet regularly
- Collectively govern automation policies
- 5-person limit prevents surveillance-scale data collection

**AI Agent Roles:**

**Personal AI Assistants** (1 per member)
- Learn individual preferences, accessibility needs, boundaries
- User-controlled automation levels

**Group Coordinator Agent**
- Scheduling with accessibility requirements
- Pattern monitoring with human verification
- Supports (never replaces) collective decisions

**Accessibility Accommodation Agent**
- Dynamic interface adaptation (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive)
- WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance
- Assistive technology integration

**Emergency Response Coordinator**
- Immediate group notification during crises
- Privacy-preserving location sharing (opt-in, time-limited)
- Human-confirmed emergency services connection

**Visual:** Network diagram showing 5 humans in center, each with personal AI assistant, surrounded by shared agents

## Slide 9: Accessibility - Not an Afterthought

**Universal Design Across All Modalities**

**👁️ Visual Disabilities**
Screen readers, high-contrast, voice-first interaction

**👂 Auditory Disabilities**
Visual alerts, text alternatives, vibration notifications

**🤚 Motor Disabilities**
Voice control, switch access, simplified gestures

**🧠 Cognitive Disabilities**
Progressive disclosure, simplified language, visual supports

**🌏 Cultural/Linguistic**
"Easy Japanese" (やさしい日本語) for non-native speakers

**Visual:** Accessibility wheel showing different modalities

**Research Foundation:** *Informed by Miyazaki's disability studies research*

**Key Insight:** *"Features designed for accessibility benefit ALL users—older adults, non-native speakers, high-stress situations"*

---

## Slide 10: Trust Calibration - User Control

**Three User-Configurable Automation Levels**

**Level 1: Suggestion Only** (default)
- AI proposes actions with full transparency
- Waits for explicit human approval
- For new users and high-stakes decisions

**Level 2: Automatic with Notification**
- AI takes predefined actions
- Immediate notification + undo window (24hr default)
- For routine tasks

**Level 3: Automatic with Escalation**
- AI acts independently on routine tasks
- Immediately escalates anomalies/high-risk situations
- For experienced users with calibrated trust

**Group Consensus Required**
All 5 members collectively decide automation policies

**Visual:** Sliding scale showing three levels with use case examples

**Key Message:** *"Trust isn't binary—it's calibrated through experience and control"*
