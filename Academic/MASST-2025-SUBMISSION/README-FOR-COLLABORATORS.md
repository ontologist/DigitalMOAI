## 🌐 Option 1: Edit Online with Overleaf (Recommended)

**Best for:** Real-time collaboration without installing LaTeX

### Steps:
1. Go to https://www.overleaf.com
2. Create free account (or login)
3. Click **"New Project"** → **"Upload Project"**
4. Upload `MASST-2025-LaTeX-Collaboration.zip`
5. Tijerino will share the project with you via email
6. Edit directly in browser - PDF updates automatically

### Advantages:
- ✅ No software installation needed
- ✅ Real-time collaborative editing (like Google Docs)
- ✅ Built-in PDF preview
- ✅ Track changes and comments
- ✅ Supports Japanese characters (神徳和子, やさしい日本語)

---

## 💻 Option 2: Edit Locally with LaTeX

**Best for:** Offline editing, experienced LaTeX users

### Prerequisites:
- LaTeX distribution installed:
  - **Mac:** MacTeX (https://tug.org/mactex/)
  - **Windows:** MiKTeX (https://miktex.org/)
  - **Linux:** TeX Live (usually pre-installed)

### Compilation Steps:

```bash
# Navigate to directory with files
cd /path/to/MASST-2025-files

# Compile (run these commands in order):
pdflatex MASST-2025-Abstract.tex
bibtex MASST-2025-Abstract
pdflatex MASST-2025-Abstract.tex
pdflatex MASST-2025-Abstract.tex

# Output: MASST-2025-Abstract.pdf
```

### Why 4 compilation steps?
1. First `pdflatex`: Generate auxiliary files
2. `bibtex`: Process bibliography
3. Second `pdflatex`: Include bibliography
4. Third `pdflatex`: Resolve all cross-references
